"1",9501,"Bell, Michael ","Manhole Arc-Flash Risk Reduction","  Power system distribution at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) consists primarily of high-voltage, underground cables. These cables include approximately 5000 splices.¾ Splice failures result in arc flash events that are extremely hazardous to personnel in the vicinity of the arc flash. Some construction and maintenance tasks cannot be performed effectively in the required personal protective equipment (PPE), and de-energizing the cables is not feasible due to cost, lost productivity, and safety risk to others implementing the required outages. To verify alternate and effective mitigations, arc flash testing was conducted in a controlled environment. The arc flash effects were greater than expected. Testing also demonstrated the addition of neutral grounding resistors (NGRs) would result in substantial reductions to arc flash effects. As a result, NGRs are being installed on KSC primary substation transformers. The presence of the NGRs, enable usage of less cumbersome PPE and increase the","  Laboratory testing revealed higher than anticipated safety risks from a potential arc-flash event in a manhole environment when conducted at KSCês unreduced fault current levels.¾ The safety risks included bright flash, excessive sound, and smoke.¾¾ Due to these findings and absence of other mitigations installed at the time, manhole entries require full arc-flash PPE.¾ Furthermore, manhole entries were temporarily restricted to short duration inspections until further mitigations could be implemented.¾ With installation of neutral grounding resistors (NGRs) on substation transformers, the flash, sound and flame energy was reduced.¾ The hazard reduction was so substantial that the required PPE would be less cumbersome and enable effective performance of maintenance tasks in the energized configuration.¾  
  With the NGR installed, the surge arresters currently used at KSC are not designed for the load and may fail during a fault causing secondary outages and increasing repair times.¾ Replacement of the surge arresters will be conducted over 2-3 years due to the resulting hundreds of facility outages and impacts. Until the surge suppressors are upgraded, the NGRs would only be used during manhole construction and maintenance operations in an approved outage period.

"5",8601,"Oberhettinger, David ","Reflight of Spacecraft Designs May be Inhibited by Inadequate Capture of Design Knowledge","  The JPL focus on primarily one-of-a-kind flight systems and missions may result in insufficient priority placed on design documentation and mission-centric knowledge retention. The OCO-2 project found the inherited Orbiting Carbon Observatory design to be poorly documented. Assure that the spaceflight project retains the design knowledge needed to duplicate a system design. Train employees at all levels to recognize the value of project-generated knowledge and to champion its retention, sharing, and reuse. ","
    Reflight of a system design is becoming a more common JPL practice. For example, the Mars 2020 mission concept under study by NASA would duplicate the successful design of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover. (If the prospective Mars 2020 flight system is not designed as an exact copy of MSL, it would likely retain major MSL elements like the Descent Stage; Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) design; and Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG)). In addition, NASA is supporting the use of common spacecraft buses (e.g., LADEE, Cubesats) that will facilitate reflight of a standard flight system design.   
    
    The JPL focus on primarily one-of-a-kind flight systems and missions may result in insufficient priority placed on design documentation and mission-centric knowledge retention. However, much technical knowledge gained over the course of a JPL project is reusable, and the actual reflight of a spacecraft design is not uncommon (e.g., Mars Polar Lander/Mars Phoenix, Jason-1/Jason-2/Jason-3, OCO/OCO-2, Mars Science Laboratory/proposed Mars 2020 mission). Even modest efforts to husband technical knowledge may reduce the cost of future projects, even ones that are not planned as build-to-print, by making the knowledge reusable.

"8",8403,"Oberhettinger, David ","Proper Use of MIL-A-8625 Type II Anodize on 2000 &amp; 7000 Series Aluminum Alloys","  Following thermal-vacuum bakeout/testing, various Mars Science Laboratory aluminum parts exhibited flaking of the black anodize coating. The flaking was traced to a known problem with Type II anodization of 2000 and 7000 series aluminum alloys. Although these coating failures were not significant for MSL, contamination from such debris poses a potentially significant mission impact. Use of Type III anodize or paint instead of Type II anodization is recommended on series 2000 and 7000 aluminum. ","   
    Type II black anodization of aluminum is commonly performed by JPL and by industry to provide a durable coating for corrosion control or to minimize glint for cameras. Although anodizing aluminum alloys by this technique is usually successful, the compatibility of certain aluminum alloys with the Type II anodize process is unpredictable. Although the coating failures caused no damage to MSL, contamination from the resulting debris can potentially have serious mission consequences.   
    
    There is some evidence that factors such as exposure of the anodized surface to extreme low-side temperature cycles (e.g., to -130C), and the deep thermal cycling associated with planetary protection measures, may affect the tendency of the coating to spall. For component surfaces that experience relatively benign total thermal variations, or for missions that do not require planetary protection bakeout, it may be feasible to specify and deliver a reliable Type II black anodize coating on 2000 and 7000 series aluminum alloys for a given flight project.

The National Academy of Sciences Astronomy Decadal Survey reaffirmed that completing the Webb Telescope was the nationês top astronomy priority. At nearly the same time, Senator Barbara Mikulski, a long-time Webb advocate, requested an independent review of the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, as the JWST Program was beginning a replan due to its continual budget troubles.

When an independent panel of experts published its review of the Program in October of 2010, its members recommended the Project shift from focusing on technology development to managing the Webbês life cycle cost and launch readiness date, with the Project getting more visibility inside NASA by reporting directly to the Goddard Center Director and the Program reporting directly to the Agencyês Associate Administrator. This lesson describes changes in the JWST Program Office's approach to management and the resulting positive outcomes, recognizing that the telescope still has years of fabrication, integration, assembly and test ahead.","Once the program was put on a sound foundation for development through launch with the JWST rebaseline in 2011, NASA had to address the management issues identified by the independent review panel. The new JWST Program Director describes changes in five areas that have led, thus far, to considerably improved telescope development performance. The areas are:

  clearly defined authority, responsibility and accountability;

Property disposition involved Centers and Prime Contractors. While NASA has property management requirements in place, Center as well as Prime Contract approaches to meet the overall requirements vary. Also, major efforts were made to coordinate and transfer property to Centers and/or future programs with changing demands. Innovative tasks were implemented to reduce schedule and costs.","The prime contractor took several opportunities to help reduce cost to the Transition and Retirement (T &  R) program as well as to reduce schedule. The following improvements implemented in the September 2011 time frame helped the prime contractor become more efficient in the Property Excess process. 

  Approval to stage tooling in locations outside of bonded stores allowed more work to be accomplished simultaneously and minimized the limitation of available space in the Excess warehouse. 

     NASA requested on the prime contractorês behalf and received a waiver from Defense Contact Management Agency (DCMA) to allow the prime to exceed a requirement without punishment. The requirement involved the 30-day time limit to dispose of property once a disposition is given. The contractual requirement involving the 30-day limit spawned another requirement that limited the number of entries allowed into the property transition/disposal system, the Plant Clearance Automated Reutilization Screening System (PCARSS). The document designated for entering an item for transition/excess is a DD1149. To comply with the requirement, a DD1149 could only be written and input into the system to cover the amount of property that could be Excessed in a month. For example, if it took 1 person 1 day to excess a bin, the maximum number of bins that could be excessed in a month was 20-25. One DD1149 could be written to excess only those 20-25 bins. To excess all 635 bins, 24 to 28 DD1149ês would have to have been written and processed. DCMA took, on average, 60 to 90 days to run each DD1149 through the PCARSS system. With the waiver, they were able to front load the system, entering one DD149 for property, such as the 635 bins. The 635 bins took 3 to 4 months to prepare for Excess. Frontloading significantly reduced the amount of data entry, redundant paperwork, and coordination required, reducing the lag time between prime contractor and DCMA activities. 


     RSRM had some property that was used in direct contact with rocket propellant. Special procedures, called 5Xing, to clean the hardware are required prior to transferring or excessing hardware to someone outside the company. Front loading the system reduced the processing time needed to start, as well as streamlining the schedule after approval. 

     Eliminating the need to re-tag material with paper tags by allowing PKAB (RSRM) tags to be equal to R006 (SLS) upon transfer completion streamlined the process of transferring hardware between contracts. Property ownership transfer records were made electronically in the material database (Impresa). This reduced the amount of physical labor and quality control required to re-tag all internally transitioned hardware. 

     Bringing in temporary employees by hiring former employees with the needed experience to expedite closeout efforts in the prime contractor warehouse known as Stores. Utilizing former employees with the specific knowledge, experience, and skills regarding hardware and other property helped the T&R team meet an aggressive Excessing schedule and accelerated the completion of transfers. 

     An IT team led by the Property Disposition team built a time-saving bridge from the prime contractorês system, Impresa, to DCMAês PCARSS, which streamlined the material entry process to a single date entry task for each property unit instead of repeating the same data entry task into each property management system.

"57",6036,"Unknown","Ground Umbilical Carrier Assembly Gaseous Hydrogen Leak Investigation","A gaseous hydrogen (GH2) leak occurred on 03/11/09, during the STS-119/ET-127 cryogenic loading for flight, and was repaired with a –fix to fly” approach by replacing the flight seal and the Ground Umbilical Carrier Assembly (GUCA) quick disconnect (QD. There was no attempt to determine the cause of the leak before the repair. An anomaly resolution team was assembled after the launch to determine the long-term approach. <br/><br/>

In successfully mating the GUCA QD to the External Tank Carrier Assembly (ETCA), the following factors play key roles: Ground Umbilical Carrier Plate (GUPC) concentricity, QD probe/flange concentricity, two-piece seal, the GUCA QDês Inconel bellows, vent line loads, alignment between the ETCA and the flight carrier plate, alignment of the hinge support brackets, and the pyrotechnic bolt. Of these eight factors, GUCP concentricity and QD probe/flange concentricity can be adjusted within limitations. <br/><br/>

Attached to this lesson is the GUCA GH2 Leak Investigation White Paper, which provides details of the investigation and process changes.<br/><A HREF=""https://nen.nasa.gov/llis_lib/pdf/1044856main_GUCA%20GH2%20Leak%20Investigation%20White%20Paper.pdf""  >Click to view white paper</A>","The most important lesson learned from these GH2 leaks is the need to understand and control process creep. Near the end of the Shuttle Program and after Hurricane Katrina hit Michoud Assembly Facility, KSC received several ETCAs whose configurations were out of tolerance. Some hinge brackets showed evidence of offset and slight clocking, and in some cases, the plate itself showed clocking. These minor deviations in assembly created enough of a stack-up problem to prevent the GUCP from tracking with the ETCA. Even though master tooling was used to manufacture the ETCA components, slight variations (which could have been avoided) were allowed to be introduced because the components were installed without the use of any indexing tooling. <br/><br/>

Another important lesson is the possibility of unintended consequences when design changes are implemented. The CRES 321 bellows was replaced with the Inconel 718 bellows to eliminate a fatigue problem and to reduce the number of parts and the refurbishment time. But the Inconel bellows was less able to track with the out-of-tolerance ETCA component installations. This change also added an unknown variable that was discovered during the investigation. Each bellows seemed to take a set during the QD assembly operation (minor offset from the flange to the probe). When the QD was stacked up with the out-of-tolerance ETCA and GUCP offset (misalignment), the cumulative concentricity differences among the components prevented the assembly from sealing at cryogenic temperatures. <br/><br/>

Another lesson is the importance of concentricity between the sealing surface and the bellows probe, as well as the rest of the assembly that could have an effect on it. The closer the concentricity offset between the sealing surface and the bellows probe is to 0, the more able the system will be to comply with (accommodate) external forces (e.g., vent line loads, wind, weather, and cryogenic loading). This understanding was instrumental in resolving the problem of the out-of-tolerance ETCA installations since the flight side could not be modified. For a critical fluid interface, the design should be such that the system excursions are experienced away from the sealing surface. The GUCA was designed to pivot about the pyrotechnic bolt, which caused the sealing surface to be dynamic. The sealing interface should have been maintained by solidly attaching the GUCP to the ETCA and allowing the flexhose to handle all the system excursions. In addition, the sealing interface was a single seal with no secondary sealing capability. A redundant seal configuration would have increased the systemês compliance to excursions. Also by having a primary and a secondary seal, along with a leak check port, a better ambient leak check could have been performed. The leak check port would have greatly increased the fidelity (smaller leak check volume) and would have allowed for the use of a helium mass spectrometer, which can detect small leaks. On all GH2 leak anomalies, an ambient leak check of the system was performed, and no leakage was observed until cryogenic loading on launch day. The ambient leak check could verify only that the system didnêt exhibit extreme misalignmentãit wasnêt a good metric to determine if the installation was acceptable for cryogenic loading.","KSC",2011-08-03,"Space Operations, ",TRUE,"Integration and Testing, Manufacturing and Assembly, Cryogenic Systems, Flight Equipment, Ground Equipment, Ground Operations, Hardware, Launch Process, Launch Vehicle, Parts, Materials, & Processes, Test & Verification, Launch Systems, Ground processing and manifesting, Ground support systems, Launch support systems, Mission operations systems, Configuration and data management, Cross Agency coordination, Product Assurance, Quality, Engineering design and project processes and standards, Planning of requirements verification processes, ",58,3,"Integration and Testing","https://nen.nasa.gov/web/11/viewall/-/viewall/6036"

The outer mold line (OML) of future spacecraft should be as clean as possible, and all protuberances and cavities should be eliminated or minimized. Definition of induced design environments for the Space Shuttle Vehicle presented a significant technical challenge when considering that in order to properly establish them, there was a need to not only define the detailed surface pressure distributions on protuberances and cavities, but also the aeroheating environment and the dynamic or fluctuating pressure field generated by these geometric features. Further, the presence of these protuberances and cavities generate effects on the near flow field as well as on surrounding surfaces. The Space Shuttle Program (SSP) embarked on the definition of these induced environments through analytical methods, subscale ground test of the mated vehicle as well as component level, and also numerical simulations. These efforts extended throughout the SSP life due to changes in protuberances (elimination and/or geometric shape changes to mitigate debris generation) or improvements in the methods (experimental and numerical) to better define design environments and reduce uncertainties. Cavities, in general, didnêt change.

After flight six with the introduction of the additional orbiters and the lighter weight tank, the program was declared operational and the capability to continue significant flight data measurements went away. In retrospect, the original strategy to obtain flight measurements was greatly limited by competition for funding and the state-of-the-art for data handling and instrumentation capability at that time.

Ground Support Equipment (GSE) safety and other areas dealing with the 1-G operations were important but were not maximized through formal human factors principles. To mitigate risk during ground processing, the Space Flight Awareness (SFA) Program (currently the SFA Employee Motivation and Recognition Program) was originated during the Mercury Program and has continued through all human space projects to date.","SFA uses a variety of motivational awards and incentives along with active education to remind the Government and industry team of their role in achieving flight safety and mission success. Training and motivation are important for the human element to perform at their best with any system. However, we must first start with the optimal system, then enhance the system with the appropriate training. Ongoing human factors analysis contributions during design of the spacecraft and associated ground systems are a key component to how flight safety and mission success can be achieved. With the new technologies and untried methods, and the importance that spacecraft processing operations play in the success of each mission, more emphasis in human factors will be required. The 0-G human factors practices for the flight crew are well in place and will be easily accepted in future programs, but 1-G human factors for the ground personnel will need special attention because there has not been an emphasis on this in previous spacecraft development.","KSC",2011-02-08,"Exploration Systems, ",FALSE,"",90,1,NA,"https://nen.nasa.gov/web/11/viewall/-/viewall/5377"

This condition can lead to depletion of the capacity within one of the two cells.","NiH2 CPV battery cell designs are susceptible to a unique electrolyte bridging between the two internal cells that can potentially result in undesired ionic current flow, which can ultimately deplete the capacity within one of the two cells. The internal design configuration of a normal CPV allows free material transport between cells as both cells within a CPV are intended to share the hydrogen gas necessary for NiH2 cell functionality. Two conditions were identified where it is possible for free potassium hydroxide (KOH) electrolyte to creep between the cell stacks and to establish an undesirable conductive ionic pathway that effectively shorts out one of the two cells within the CPV. Those conditions are: 1) activating the NiH2 CPV cells with excess electrolyte present or 2) allowing the cells to reach very low states of charge during operation. Based on observations and available data, once the electrolyte bridge is established there are no effective means to eliminate the problem with the possible exception of fully reconditioning the battery cell, or at least extended operation (up to a few weeks) in an open circuit condition. </br>

"147",4436,"Kortes, Trudy ","Lessons Learned from Radioisotope Power Systems (RPS) Programmatic Review","The Radioisotope Power Systems (RPS) Program Office recently completed a System Requirements Review (SRR), System Definition Review (SDR) (per NPR 7123.1) and an Independent Life Cycle Review (ILCR) Program Approval Review (PAR) (per NID 7120.5) from May, 2010 - August, 2010 in preparation for Key Decision Point (KDP) I which takes the Program from a formulation phase to an implementation phase. During these reviews, some lessons learned noted were; 
  Use review success criteria as a basis for the review agenda   
  Ensure that the scope of the review is well communicated to all parties   
  Arrange for a neutral party to observe during the review and provide feedback to the program/project office.   </ul>","Planning: 

  The Program utilized its draft Program Plan as an outline for the PAR based on benchmarking with other loosely coupled Agency programs. In hindsight, we would have served the Standing Review Board (SRB) better if we had developed the outline and agenda based on the review success criteria as detailed in NPR 7120.5 Section 2.5.4 and any success criteria noted in the Terms of Reference (TOR) Document.   

   Know your audience! The SRB is an independent board formulated by the HQ Independent Program Assessment Office (IPAO). Once we had the names and titles of people confirmed as SRB members, it would have served us well to have a detailed meeting with all presenters so that they were well aware of who would be in attendance, their areas of focus, and the key issues they might look to understand.   

   The more dry runs, the better. The Program held several dry runs, a table top review with each individual presenter as a first glance at draft charts, a dry run of charts with the entire Program Office present, an ""in-situ"" dry run held at the actual location of the event (very helpful to  ensure your administrative support is familiar with AV equipment and that support need requests can be submitted in a timely fashion), and a chart run-through with Directorate management. However, it is recommended to include someone with Program or Project management experience who is familiar with Program or project reviews and completely independent from the office to take a fresh look at the chart package and how it will be presented. (If done right, this could take up a person's entire day, so make sure that person has time and is willing to commit that time to helping out.) Another dry run that could be scheduled is specifically a ""tough questions"" session in order to prepare presenters and also come to a common office understanding of how to answer particular questions.   

   Determine early in the planning process what is in and out of scope of the review and hold to that. SRB members may want to investigate an area that is outside of the scope of the review and it is completely appropriate to ensure that the scope of the review is understood and adhered to. IPAO can assist with this agreement in the Terms of Reference Document.   

   Make sure there is a lead integrator who knows the content of the presentation extremely well. Program management is focused on answering questions, and this function is necessary to facilitate the meeting especially when the SRB may want to skip topics or jump to particular topics.   

   Scheduling an outside activity or two for an independent board was encouraged and appreciated, but do this early in the review. Once they get into the main part of the process, they will get busy and probably work well into the evenings to complete the review on time, depending on the agenda laid out for them.   

   Ensure all stakeholders/Program or project participants or representatives of those participants are present for a review of this proportion. This may mean Headquarters personnel (Program Executive or Director) or outside external agencies or other centers or matrixed personnel who are pivotal and key to your Program or project.   

   If possible, have a neutral party present during the review. This should be someone who knows something about the Program or project but isn't necessarily directly involved. This allows things like real-time feedback so that adjustments can be made and also ensures valuable post-review feedback.   

  Provided a pre-brief of the PAR material to functional line and programmatic line management, such as the HQ Program Executive and Director.   

   Pay attention to repeat information. A certain amount of that is fine (for example showing the same chart a couple of times in different locations) to make sure the audience is familiar with key information. But, too much repetition could lead to a perception of ""glossing over"" certain key information, so strike a good balance with chart integration.   

   Emphasize to presenters that they thoroughly know the content of what they are presenting.   

   Ensure that a comprehensive chart package is pulled together using the same formatting and template. Our review had multiple presenters providing multiple chart packages. Provide a format up front for all to follow, but then have a chart making expert on staff put the final package together. Do not underestimate the time it takes to do this and do it well. RPS started producing charts for this review in early July for an August 30 review and it was a difficult to complete in that timeframe. Allow 2 or more months for chart preparation.   

   The amount of time and effort to plan and execute a review of this magnitude was underestimated.    </ul>

Review: 

   If an SRB wants to spend more or less time on particular topics, be flexible. Be prepared, but be willing to ""call an audible"" real time in order to ensure the SRB is focusing on key topics.   

   One of the unwritten goals of a review like this is to build credibility with the SRB which means being forthcoming in answering questions and providing information.   </ul>","GRC",2010-12-06,"Aeronautics Research, ",FALSE,"Program Management, Review boards, Program level review processes, Review systems and boards, Mission definition and planning, ",151,34,"Program Management","https://nen.nasa.gov/web/11/viewall/-/viewall/4436"

"157",3698,"Pitt, Marie","Hypergol Servicing Automation","The use of automation in propellant loading for the Space Shuttle has significantly reduced human error and servicing time. For the STS-2 launch, 6 hours were required to load the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) tank and 4 hours to load the Reaction Control System (RCS) tank. This propellant loading was done manually until the STS-26R mission, when autosequencers were introduced. The autosequencers were developed during the downtime between the loss of the Orbiter Challenger and the return to flight. By the end of the Shuttle program, 3 hours were allocated for OMS loading, which included about 1.5 hours of sequencer run time. The RCS loading planned time was 45 minutes, but the sequencer actually finished this task in about 30 minutes. <br>
</br>   
The development and execution of automated sequencers is one of the most significant accomplishments of the Space Shuttle OMS/RCS team.","Automated procedures using the existing LPS led to improvements in quality, safety, and operating cost. Development of automated sequencers allowed for automatic monitoring of instrumentation with a planned automatic securing and safing response.    

Using a computer system with fewer limitations and greater capability (such as programmable logic controllers, or PLCs) than the Shuttle programês LPS would allow for a better, more detailed automated process. Stops for exceptions could be programmed to provide planned actions for the operator. (For example, more information from the knowledge base and responses to anomalies could be built into the process.) This would reduce real-time documentation and the need to process paperwork for deviations. The test team would be able to confirm the event and immediately take corrective action if necessary.

Besides the normal certification testing criteria for what is classically considered failure modes for passive system elements, the effects of manufacturing defects, improper cleaning and drying, storage, handling, operational use and collateral damage should also be taken into account when determining their in service maintenance requirements and life. Also when using metal bellows flex hoses in an application where the hose extends and retracts it is important to ensure that the minimum bend radius is not exceeded and that there is no induced reverse bending occurring during the entire travel of the hose. It is very difficult if not impossible to detect, by inspection, impending reverse bending fatigue failure of the metal bellows convolutes that occurs due to storage, handling, operational use ( hoses that are routinely disconnected and connected ) and incidental collateral damage.","KSC",2010-10-01,"Exploration Systems, Space Operations, ",FALSE,"Aircraft, Computer-Aided Design / Manufacturing / Engineering, Cryogenic Systems, Facilities, Ground Equipment, Ground Operations, Hardware, Industrial Operations, Launch Vehicle, Logistics, Packaging, Handling, Storage, Parts, Materials, & Processes, Pressure Vessels, Risk Management / Assessment, Safety & Mission Assurance, Spacecraft, Test & Verification, Environmental Control and Life Support Systems, Ground processing and manifesting, Ground support systems, Launch support systems, Logistics and maintenance, Lunar Operations, Planetary entry and landing concepts, Early requirements and standards definition, Maintenance, Quality, Reliability, Human factors planning, ",163,16,"Aircraft","https://nen.nasa.gov/web/11/viewall/-/viewall/5479"

This type of leak test typically involves pressurizing the system, configuring its fluid components to lock up pressure in all or part of the system, and then monitoring for a decay in pressure. Total overall leakage from the system can be calculated using the system volume and measured decay rate.    

For systems with multiple components in series, more than one test may be required to validate the entire system. A system-level decay test typically is less intrusive than multiple component-level leak checks; and in most cases, the allowable decay for the system can be established so that the decay test would fail if a major component has more internal leakage than is allowable. In addition to saving time and resources, this type of test offers the benefit of detecting gross external leakage from a damaged component such a cracked line or ruptured flex hose.    

A system-level decay test acts as a good integrity check that the system is ready for use. A system-level decay test is typically not meant to replace component-level leak checks performed to test a replaced component; however, if the component-level check is not possible or practical, the system-level leak check may give adequate confidence that the system is functioning properly.

NLS connectors are commonly referred to as high-density connectors because of their generally high number of small contacts per connector (up to 128 size 22D contacts in a single connector). From a design perspective, 128-pin NLS connectors offer space and weight advantages but are challenging from a vehicle-processing perspective. Pictures of the front and back of an NLS connector are attached. The front view shows a bent pin. The back view shows the density of the wiring attached to the connector.","Though high-density connectors offer many design benefits, they present significant challenges for vehicle processing and anomaly resolution. They are more susceptible to damage than low-density connectors and carry significant retesting requirements if they are demated. High-density connectors should be used sparingly, and whenever possible, systems should not share a connector.

However, these external AC inverters are fed by the Orbiterês main DC busses, which are directly fed by DC power supplied by the fuel cell itself. On two separate occasions, an FCP was inadvertently removed from the main DC bus, causing the associated AC inverters (and hence the coolant and hydrogen circulation pumps) to lose power. This caused a potentially dangerous overheating condition within the fuel cell. A better design would be to power all internal critical components with the fuel cellês own internal DC power. Future designs should either use DC rotary equipment to power the fuel cell, use internal AC inverters and power the FCP with the DC power that the fuel cell produces, or utilize passive (non-powered) thermal control methods.","Having the FCP obtain the electrical power it needs to run its pumps from the spacecraftês electrical system creates an inherent risk to fuel cell operation. This risk could be alleviated by designing the FCP so that it draws parasitic power directly from the electrical power it is providing to the spacecraft in order to operate its pump and instrumentation.

When RCC is exposed to high temperatures, it oxidizes rapidly, so a coating is required to reduce its exposure to oxygen. Reactions with these coatings can cause subsurface voids in the RCC. To accurately inspect and assess the condition of the RCC, a nondestructive evaluation (NDE) is required to see under the outside coatings. Thermography is one method that was utilized for RCC inspections. When using NDE as an inspection process, the criteria and baselines have to be well developed to accurately interpret the results so that indications are understood and an accurate assessment can be made to determine the acceptability of the condition observed.","Although NDE did provide a much better view of the subsurface conditions and should be used for this situation, it is equally important to perform a baseline study to calibrate the results.

However, the end-to-end system, including the ground checkout consoles and associated software, has limitations that led to ground processing inefficiencies. The flight systems were upgraded with new capabilities, whereas the related ground systems were not. This resulted in inefficiencies that occur during checkout and operation of the DPS. These DPS problems were first documented in ""Shuttle Avionics Design Constraints & Considerations Guide Book,"" dated April 25, 1995 (attached), and were updated to reflect recent experience. Also, attached is a photo showing the installation of the ground-use-only video camera for remotely monitoring the feed from the DPS Multifunction Display Unit during ground checkout.","       When flight system capabilities are improved (e.g., from tape-based MMUs to new solid-state mass memory), the corresponding ground systems should be improved (e.g., LPS data buffer and launch data bus handshaking time) to gain the full efficiencies offered by the new flight capabilities. 
      The inability to remotely select edge key actuation of MEDS from the firing room console or GOAL application programs makes it impossible to automate the checkout of MEDS or include reconfiguration in the DPS Console Set software, resulting in DPS ground processing inefficiencies.

Testing and training on these systems through simulation must also be carefully managed.","Systems that support critical operations are typically designed with redundancy and flexibility that allows testing to continue in the event of significant hardware failure (Fail-Ops). The LPS is augmented with enough hardware to support launch countdown in this manner. However, much of this hardware is not needed on a day-to-day basis. To maximize support capability, strategies have been developed that take advantage of this additional hardware; chief among them is the split-set function wherein one Firing Room is used to support two (or more) concurrent operations. The benefits of this flexibility can be significant, but come with significant risk. The likelihood of human error is increased when multiple tasks are supported from one location, and it is often impossible to prevent problems on one set from propagating into the other. <br/>

Of particular concern are simulation activities and software testing, because it can be difficult for the user to discern whether the system is connected to a simulator or to actual hardware. During software validation and simulations using the Space Shuttle LPS, commands have been inadvertently directed to both ground support equipment (GSE) and flight hardware.

  The IDC purge components were not designed to prevent overpressurization, which caused system failure.  
   Instead of a Bepco enclosure pressure control valve, a Bepco control panel rapid-exchange valve was used to control GN2 system purge. This allowed the rapid release of overpressure, which in turn caused the system to fail.   
  The IDC single-stage regulator was found to have vibrated open, causing the inlet pressure to increase (creep) to 50 psi. The nominal operational pressure setting is 10 psi. This increase in the inlet pressure setting allowed the system to become overpressurized and caused the system to fail.   
   The IDC camera head enclosure lid was not sealed properly because of ground wire interference, which caused a differential in system pressure between enclosures.  
  The bottom clip on the IDC camera battery, power supply, and power supply enclosure were seated but did not catch the enclosure door, which contributed to system purge leakage.  
  NASA lab personnel completed measurement testing before the ICD was put into operational use. However, purge system operation and functional checkout were not performed, which prevented detection of system overpressurization before operational use.  
  The current operational procedure, MDA Prototype Ice Detection Camera User Manual Rev 4.0, was not followed. Use of that operational procedure might have prevented the system overpressurization.

"248",2837,"Pitt, Annette ","Mechanism Problems Because of Tight Rigging Tolerances","Due to extremely tight tolerances, rigging of the Orbiterês Manipulator Positioning Mechanism (MPM) required the use of instrumentation to set some of the mechanical components. This greatly complicates and lengthens the rigging process. It also increases the risk of failures/problems because of a higher likelihood of the system being improperly adjusted. It also makes the system more susceptible to problems in flight because of thermal and zero-G effects that cannot be screened for during ground checkout. Designs need to be robust enough that rigging tolerances of a few thousandths of an inch are not necessary.","Requiring such tight rigging tolerances on the mechanical components created several problems and made the process of rigging the mechanisms very complex. The team decided that the best way to determine the on-center position of the linkage was by monitoring the load in the drive rod. Theoretically, the load should peak at the on-center position. In order to measure this so that the stop could be set within the required 0.002 inch tolerance, a linear transducer was installed on the drive bellcrank, and strain gauges were attached to the drive rod. Testing on the flight hardware showed that because of friction and other inconsistencies, the location of the peak load varied depending on the speed at which the linkage was cycled and the direction (stow or deploy). The team eventually decided that the on-center position would be based on an average of the positions of the stow and deploy peak loads, weighted toward the stow position. However, the amount of variability in this measurement resulted in some risk that the stop bolt position would not be set within the required range. The design of the hardware should not require this level of accuracy to ensure proper operation. Additionally, the team found that other seemingly minor things had an effect on the performance of the mechanism. It was discovered that the way the pedestal assembly was attached to the test stand made enough of a difference that it caused it to exceed some of the spec limits. This was because of minor deflections in the base plate of the assembly because of how it was secured to the stand. Also, such tight rigging requirements make the system more susceptible to problems in flight. During ground checkout it is not possible to simulate all the conditions the hardware will experience on-orbit. The effects of zero-G and thermal changes cannot be screened for on the ground. During the first few flights after the modified MPM hardware was installed, there were some problems with the performance of the limit switches. Even during prelaunch operations at the pad we found that the limit switches transferred differently than they did during horizontal processing in the Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF). In flight, some of the limit switch indications did not come on during the cycles but then transferred on some time later. These were believed to be because of thermal effects on orbit. Eventually the specification was updated, and the limit switch rigging was relaxed to account for these issues.","KSC",2010-05-17,"Exploration Systems, Space Operations, ",FALSE,"Ground Operations, Spacecraft, Orbiting Vehicles, Ground processing and manifesting, ",254,11,"Ground Operations","https://nen.nasa.gov/web/11/viewall/-/viewall/2837"

<br/> One example of the value of wire harness IDs in the Shuttle Program is the ability to determine the wire function using only the wire ID. A worst-case scenario is wire damage detected during final closeouts, and when post repair requires a functional retest. If the function is unknown, there are two ways to resolve this condition: perform extensive hardware removals to isolate the wire function or perform functional retest of all wires in the harness. A complete functional retest of all the wires in the harness may not be possible if it contains functions that cannot be retested in the vertical configuration. In this case, it would cause flight hardware removals to isolate the function. The removal of flight hardware in final closeouts would likely drive a slip in the planned launch date. Depending on the vehicle design, this issue could result in the de-stack of the vehicle. <br/>

During the intervening time when the technicians were evacuated, the open storage tank released an estimated 12,236 cubic feet of oxidizer vapor into the atmosphere. A number of personnel were exposed to the vapor in the downwind area.","Because there is no design to prevent the release of propellant when the storage tank relief valves are removed, effective scheduling of an operation to accomplish the removal is essential. Plan the task for winter when the propellant will be colder. Maintenance at temperatures below 68 çF on N2O4 storage system will greatly reduce the boil-off of N2O4. <br/> 
<br/> 
Nominal maintenance items on hypergolic storage vessels that will require replacement or calibration should be designed in such a way that will allow maintenance or calibration to be done while not requiring major hazardous operations or the need to completely drain the storage vessel of propellant. Since ASME code does not allow an isolation valve in front of a relief valve, a design with more than one relief valve with a three-way isolation valve will allow compliance with the code and also allow isolation of one relief valve for maintenance. <br/>
<br/> 
In this design, the tank is always protected by a relief device and the design allows for the purging of the off-line relief valve pipe and the replacement of the relief valve as a minor hazardous operation. This design also allows for the annual calibration to be accomplished with the RV installed. Processing costs are reduced and personnel and the effect on the environment are controlled. The importance of effective and correct evaluation of outstanding ESRs is demonstrated in this case. If the effect on the environment of the annual replacement and the risk to personnel was correctly evaluated and acted upon, then this event could have been eliminated.

Troubleshooting revealed that the requirements used to verify the shoulder brace latch prior to flight were not as accurate as thought. Historically, console program VAB40 was used to provide the data for the shoulder pitch angle prior to latching the shoulder brace.

"261",2839,"Pitt, Annette ","Reduced Torque Output from Electro-Mechanical Actuators","Reduced torque output of the orbiterês electromechanical actuators has been a problem for the Shuttle Program. It has resulted in unplanned work to test, remove, and refurbish the actuators. Disassembly and inspection has revealed that the torque reduction is a result of problems with the torque limiters and the motor clutch/brake assemblies in the actuators. Refurbishment is a lengthy process because of the difficulty involved in setting the torque limiter to operate through the required temperature range. The next generation of actuators should have a better design, or the mechanical system should be capable of withstanding the maximum output loads of the actuator.","The torque limiters of the External Tank door actuators were redesigned in the early 1990s because of unacceptable degradation of the disk friction surfaces. The new design was a multidisk ball-ramp setup. When the torque reached a certain value, the ball-ramp design reduced the compression load on the disk stack and allowed the disks to rotate relative to each other (slip). The disks in this particular actuator were made of steel and Vespel. After several years of service with the new torque limiter design, most of the actuators exhibited reduced torque output. Investigation determined that the torque limiter degradation was due to grease contamination of the disk surfaces. Inspection confirmed that excess grease was applied to some of the torque limiter components (bearings) during assembly and eventually migrated to the disk surfaces. However, even after the actuators were refurbished, excess grease was removed, and the grease was cleaned from the disks, the actuators often continued to exhibit torque degradation and show evidence of grease contamination of the disks. Another problem was the amount of effort required to set the torque limiter to slip in the required range when the actuator was being serviced. The value at which the torque limiter slips depends somewhat on the temperature, and the actuator is required to operate with a specified torque output through a large temperature range (over 300 çF). Several rounds of adjustments were needed, each followed by days of testing. <br/>
<br/>
In addition, there was degradation of the motor clutch/brake assemblies in these actuators. Each actuator has two AC motors, each of which interfaces with the gear box differential through a clutch/brake assembly. For redundancy, the actuator will operate on only one motor. When a motor is not operating, the clutch/brake assembly is in the brake mode. A friction disk is spring-loaded against a stator, which locks the input to the differential and disconnects it from the motor. This is necessary so that during single-motor operation, the nonoperating motor input is not back-driven through the differential. When the motor starts up, the assembly switches to clutch mode. A solenoid pulls the disk away from the stator, separating the brake surfaces and engaging the clutch surface of the disk to the motor output. The motor then drives the differential input through the clutch. During tests of the actuators on the vehicle, the torque output varied significantly by motor mode. Since there is a single torque limiter, the point at which it slips should be the same regardless of which motor is operating. This indicated that the clutch/brake assembly was slipping prematurely. Disassembly and inspection confirmed that both the clutch and brake surfaces were worn. There was evidence of scoring on the interfacing surfaces and metallic debris in the assembly.","KSC",2010-05-04,"Exploration Systems, Space Operations, ",FALSE,"Ground Operations, Launch Vehicle, Spacecraft, Entry Systems, Orbiting Vehicles, Ground processing and manifesting, Review systems and boards, Engineering design and project processes and standards, Long term sustainability and maintenance planning, ",267,25,"Ground Operations","https://nen.nasa.gov/web/11/viewall/-/viewall/2839"

As a solution, a new type of part tag, called a –traveler,” was developed. With the traveler, the tracking system can fill in the data for each unique part without the need for a separate WAD. The traveler contains all the basic information found in a part tag, plus the additional information needed for tracking and processing. During processing, a removed part is tagged to identify its part number, serial number, and condition, and space is provided for a quality inspection stamp and date. Information on the authorizing document and next higher assembly may also be entered.","Although using part tags works well if a single item or a handful of items is being processed, it does not work well when a large number are being processed. To use part tags in high-volume processing, the WAD must either contain detailed steps for each part or a matrix must be used to ensure each partês requirements are met. <br/>
<br/>

For the new process, each part was assigned a unique bar code, a database was created with information on each part, and a new form (the blanket traveler) then captured any additional information or requirements pertaining to the bar codes associated with it. The traveler was developed to replace both the part tag and the IPD sheet. <br/>
<br/>

Travelers offer a number of advantages over part tags. The traveler captures the detailed installation requirements from the drawing. It details the condition of each part, as well as the state (installation, etc.) of the part. It also contains buy-offs for all steps required to process the part (e.g., removal, inspection, approval to install, completion of installation, torque, and grounding). Unlike part tags, travelers can associate a part with a particular vehicle, installation drawing, or zone, or with a WAD for removal/installation; reflect when a part is installed; and show the final location of the part. The traveler may include references to Material Review (MR) conditions and reference the MR WAD number or one-of-a-kind work steps and buys. <br/>
<br/>

A travelerês information can be readily updated or corrected, and the information for the specific part can be printed.","KSC",2010-04-27,"Exploration Systems, Space Operations, ",FALSE,"Configuration Management, Ground Operations, Logistics, Mishap Reporting, NASA Standards, Occupational Health, Packaging, Handling, Storage, Parts, Materials, & Processes, Payloads, Personal Protective Equipment, Policy & Planning, Pressure Vessels, Procurement, Small Business & Industrial Relations, Program and Project Management, Range Operations, Research & Development, Risk Management / Assessment, Safety & Mission Assurance, Security, Software, Spacecraft, Standard, Test & Verification, Test Article, Test Facility, Training Equipment, Transportation, Ground processing and manifesting, Configuration control and data management, ",271,12,"Configuration Management","https://nen.nasa.gov/web/11/viewall/-/viewall/3039"
"266",2838,"Pitt, Annette ","Loads from Soft Goods Not Fully Considered During Design of Mechanical Systems","The effects of soft goods (environmental seals, pressure seals, thermal barriers, etc.) were not fully considered during the design of several of the orbiter mechanical systems. During rerigging efforts at KSC, it was not possible to meet all the requirements in the drawings/specifications because much of the initial rigging was done without the installation of these soft goods. Loads induced by the soft goods prevented the mechanisms from operating within the required ranges. This was most evident during the rerigging of OV-103ês landing gear after the Columbia accident. The design process should ensure that the loads of soft goods are understood and considered. Also, field rigging specifications should be developed to allow for rework of the system postdelivery.","There were no requirements to verify the seal compression. Proper compression was assumed based on meeting the door-to-structure flushness requirement. There was also no requirement to verify the height of the seals. There was a postflight visual inspection only.<br/> 
<br/>
Attempts to adjust the mechanism to obtain the proper seal compression and door position confirmed that the mechanism was not capable of overcoming the loads of the seals and other soft goods without exceeding other parameters of the rigging specification. Ultimately, some parts of the mechanism were instrumented to ensure that the loads in the critical components remained within acceptable limits. In addition, after the STS-114 rerigging effort was complete, small changes in seal or thermal-barrier stiffness (when components were replaced) resulted in unacceptable changes in the door positions. This often resulted in extensive testing and rework in subsequent flows. There were similar problems with other orbiter mechanical systems, including the ingress/egress hatch and External Tank umbilical doors. <br/>
<br/>
 Furthermore, when the system was reworked in the field, it was not always possible to comply with the mechanical rigging specifications. The specs were written from a manufacturing perspective, and often the seals and other Thermal Protection System components were not installed. Following the spec in the field was not always practical because it required that the hardware be returned to the original build configuration. This resulted in partial compliance with the specs and the need for material reviews to document deviations from the spec or out-of-spec conditions.","KSC",2010-04-27,"Exploration Systems, Space Operations, ",FALSE,"Ground Operations, Spacecraft, Entry Systems, Orbiting Vehicles, Ground processing and manifesting, Engineering design and project processes and standards, Long term sustainability and maintenance planning, ",272,25,"Ground Operations","https://nen.nasa.gov/web/11/viewall/-/viewall/2838"

Investigations revealed a deficiency in the telemetry station recording process, which was subsequently resolved by changing the RF data recording format from digital to analog.","Preconfigured, operator-specified bit sync parameters compensate for nominal frequency and bit jitter variations in PCM data, allowing the bit sync to recover data from an imperfect stream. However, RF data is often very noisy and can be further degraded by vehicle exhaust plumes. These factors preclude the effective use of predefined bit sync parameters. To eliminate this problem, RPS started recording the PCM signal in analog (unprocessed) format, eliminating all PCM signal processing and the potential for invalid data.","KSC",2010-04-26,"Exploration Systems, Space Operations, ",FALSE,"Ground Equipment, Ground Operations, Security, Software, Test & Verification, Crew Survival Systems, Ground support systems, Launch support systems, Configuration control and data management, Human factors impact on mission design, Engineering design and project processes and standards, ",273,8,"Ground Equipment","https://nen.nasa.gov/web/11/viewall/-/viewall/2737"

As the result of a technology transfer effort, GMS was manufactured by a commercial vendor. The design of GMS was still undergoing changes during its implementation at the pad. Several components of the system never became fully operational. These complications eventually led the Ground Instrumentation department to replace GMS with a COTS implementation (GMS2/CDAS).","It would have been beneficial to capture the end-userês requirements prior to the design phase. GMS encountered several roadblocks and the need for major design changes during attempts to implement the system. One component of the system, which required many work hours of troubleshooting, never attained full functionality. In addition, one of the advertised benefits of GMS was the ability to locate the signal conditioning and amplifier circuitry near the transducer or measurement device, but this scheme was also fraught with problems and proved extremely hard to implement in the launch environment. Another weakness observed was the lack of continuing support. In this case, designers were involved in several projects and had limited resources available to assist after the system had been turned over to the end user. This problem could have been avoided by using a COTS system.","KSC",2010-04-25,"Space Operations, ",FALSE,"Ground Equipment, Ground Operations, Test & Verification, Entry Systems, Ground support systems, Crew operations and support concepts, Acquisition / procurement strategy and planning, Business processes, Engineering design and project processes and standards, Long term sustainability and maintenance planning, ",274,26,"Ground Equipment","https://nen.nasa.gov/web/11/viewall/-/viewall/2956"

Ground-provided umbilicals that separate from the spacecraft at launch provide primary loop single-phase coolant to the onboard heat exchanger from the circulation unit located at the base of the launch pad. The collected heat is in turn rejected from this primary coolant loop to a secondary two-phase refrigerant system. This method of heat rejection proved to be unreliable and difficult to control for the ground cooling system operator because the spacecraft heat loads varied. A much more stable, reliable system was put in place when a third intermediate loop was implemented into the ground cooling system with a heating element that allowed the refrigerant loop to operate at a constant set point.","To reject varying spacecraft heat loads prior to launch, circulate a primary loop single-phase refrigerant through the spacecraft-to-ground heat exchanger while maintaining a constant heat load via a heater on a secondary ground loop to a tertiary two-phase refrigeration loop because that makes a more stable and reliable system for ground-cooling equipment than the previously used variable-load system. <br/>

A subsequent investigation discovered that the OHMITE Maxi-Mox series resistors in the power supply circuitry have a hollow core, which, during the rapid ascent of the sounding rocket, did not have sufficient time to properly vent. This resulted in coronal arcing in the resistor and subsequent failure of the power supplyês feedback op-amp. It is recommended that hollow core resistors only be used in situations where they are given sufficient time to reach vacuum prior to high voltage being applied.","The Maxi-Mox resistors could be used in space flight if a sufficiently long interval is allowed for the cavity in the core to reach vacuum; however, because the pump-out rate varies from resistor to resistor, the point at which the arcing occurs on the resistor is indeterminate and, therefore, these resistors are not suitable for use on sounding rockets or space flight applications where a long pump out is not feasible.

<br/>
Projects were responsible for transporting their test equipment to the flight locations, verifying their test equipment was flightworthy, and staffing their experiments during flight. Personnel participating in the flights had to undergo training and meet certain medical criteria. <br/>
<br/>
Although all the experiments were executed without any problems, subsequent discussions revealed areas of improvement that could be incorporated into future planning. These suggestions included preparing a list of flight-qualified participants that could be called in case the scheduled people could not carry out their assigned duties and having a central point of contact between each Center and HQ to prevent duplication of effort if multiple projects were coming from one NASA center.

During the transition from the Orbital Space Plane Project (OSP) Program to the Constellation Program, the requirements for applying human factors engineering to the design of tasks related to the ground processing of space vehicles were not well-defined. Since that time, these 1-G (Earth gravity) human factors requirements have been defined at different levels of maturity depending upon whether they relate to flight hardware/software, ground support systems (GSS), or ground support equipment (GSE). Effectively, all of these areas are leveraging human factors engineering to optimize ground processing of flight hardware. <br/>
<br/>
This document includes lessons learned for incorporating human factors design considerations in the following areas: within the outer mold line of the flight hardware, at the ground systems-to-flight systems interface, and in the design of GSS and GSE leading up to the flight systems interface. The major focus is on current requirements and processes for applying human factors considerations in the design of GSS and GSE, taking into account that this involves a large program that does not list human factors engineering as a separate item in the work breakdown structure (WBS). The attached paper illustrates the importance of human factors engineering in the design of ground processing and launch operations for launch vehicles.","    Use available experiences and lessons from prior programs to optimize ground processing operability by leveraging human  capabilities, not exceeding them.     

Employ people qualified in human factors engineering on the team from the beginning of the project.       
Make human factors a proactive part of the design process with well-defined requirements that add value to the design.       
Voice the need for human factors accommodations where appropriate. Even if these comments are not accepted, the effort is worthwhile because it helps to develop a better awareness of the importance of human factors.     
 
In document reviews, look at previous successful human factors program documentation such as Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) lessons learned publications, and make comments to promote consideration of human factors.     
Try to incorporate human factors into the design proactively, reactively, and everywhere. When resources are limited (which is often the case when using human factors engineering in a particular engineering culture for the first time), apply them to the areas that will produce the best results. Also, build on past successes and combine the work done on multiple successful projects.     
Creating human factors requirements at a higher level is important in gaining acceptance of human factors requirements at lower levels.     
Future NASA programs should consider incorporating all Level 2 (L2) human factors requirements into one document such as CxP 70024, Constellation Program: Human-Systems Integration Requirements (HSIR), i.e., include the ground processing human factors requirements for ground hardware with the ground processing human factors requirements for flight hardware.     
Recommend that pilot testing of new processes be done as soon as possible, but make sure that the pilot test will produce added value.      
When processes already exist, try to modify them to incorporate the human factors design considerations.      
Exercise patience and be ready to compromise in gaining acceptance of new requirements.     
From the beginning, make sure existing documentation is understood. Work early to improve the existing documentation or obtain a buy-in from all parties that the human factors requirements document can supersede existing documentation.      
Because MIL-STD-1472 was used as a human factors standard in the past, it is hard to adopt a requirements document with less content, even though complying with the more than 1,700 requirements in MIL-STD-1472 would have been very difficult.     
Human factors engineers should perform the human factors assessment as embedded members of the design team.

"310",2196,"Bell, Michael ","Hypergolic Propellant Related Spills and Fires","The attached  report is a compilation of all credible, unintentional hypergolic fluid related spills, fires, and explosions from the Apollo Program, the Space Shuttle Program, Titan Program, and a few other programs. Spill sites include the following government facilities: KSC, JSC, WSTF, VAFB, CCAFS, EAFB, Little Rock AFB, and McConnell AFB.
<br/>The root causes and consequences of the incidents contained in this document vary drastically; however, certain themes can be deduced and utilized for future hypergolic propellant handling.   Some of those common themes are summarized below:
       Improper configuration control and complacency can lead to being falsely comfortable with a system    
  Communication breakdown can escalate an incident to a level where injuries occur and/or hardware is damaged    
  Improper propulsion system and ground support system designs can destine a system for failure    
  Improper training of technicians, engineers, and safety personnel can put lives in danger    
  Improper PPE, spill protection, and staging of fire extinguishing equipment can result in unnecessary injuries or hardware damage if an incident occurs    
  Improper procedural oversight, development, and adherence to the procedure can be detrimental and quickly lead to an undesirable incident    
  Improper local cleanliness or compatibility can result in fires or explosions      
The items listed above are only a short list of the issues that should be recognized prior to handling of hypergolic fluids or processing of vehicles containing hypergolic propellants. The summary of incidents in this report is intended to cover many more issues than those listed above that have been found during nearly the entire spectrum of hypergolic propellant and/or vehicle processing.
<br/>","Some common lessons learned deduced from the various root causes of the studied incidents are shown in the following list. If these items were properly addressed prior to the incidents, prevention may have been possible (in hindsight) or the ramifications of the incident could have been reduced.
  Improper configuration control and internal or external human performance shaping factors can lead to a false comfort level .   
<ol type=""i"">   Vent systems are often neglected and treated as non-hazardous even though they can capture and contain condensed hypergolic liquids (especially in low points) .  
  Aging support hardware should be routinely inspected to reduce the risk of a failure during critical operations.     
  Communication breakdown can escalate an incident to a level where injuries occur or hardware is damaged   
<ol type=""i"">   Communication protocols should be pre-coordinated prior to an operation      
  Improper propulsion system and ground support system designs can destine a system for failure   
<ol type=""i"">   Every effort should be made to design out low points in GSE   
   Unknown incompatibilities (from lack of training or research) with propellants can cause surprising failures      
   Improper training of technicians, engineers, and safety personnel can put lives in danger   
<ol type=""i"">   Inadequate knowledge of potential electrostatic discharge hazards while working fuel operations can lead to a fire or explosion   
   Knowledge of instrumentation error and/or offsets are very important for system oversight      
   Improper personal protective equipment, spill protection, and staging of fire extinguishing equipment can result in unnecessary injuries or hardware damage if an incident occurs   
   Improper procedural oversight (along with the development of and adherence to the procedure) can be detrimental and quickly lead to an incident   
<ol type=""i"">   Improper emergency procedures can increase the risk of injuries or hardware damage      
   Improper local cleanliness or housekeeping (for example iron oxide or rust) can result in fires or explosions   
   A thorough hypergol system evacuation should be completed (wherever a vacuum is tolerable by the system) prior to the removal or disconnection of any hypergolic propellant fittings   
   A pulse purge using an inert gas has proven to be inadequate for residual propellant removal   
   Advance warning of an incident appears approximately 50% of the time (according to the data presented); therefore, personnel supporting a hypergol operation should be cognizant of any system fluctuations and be prepared to execute safing procedures if the need arises   
<ol type=""i"">   A heightened amount of situational awareness of technicians and engineers working operations can reduce the risk of an incident and decrease the possibility of injuries or damage if an incident does occur

"311",2050,"Oberhettinger, David ","NASA Study of Flight Software Complexity","Flight software development problems led NASA to study the factors that have led to the accelerating growth in flight software size and complexity. The March 2009 report on the NASA Study on Flight Software Complexity contains recommendations in the areas of systems engineering, software architecture, testing, and project management.","    Engineers and scientists often don't realize the downstream complexity (and cost) that result from their local decisions. Overly stringent requirements and simplistic hardware interfaces can complicate software; FSW descope decisions and ill-conceived autonomy can complicate operations; and inattention to testability can complicate verification efforts.
<br><br/>    Unsubstantiated requirements have caused unnecessary FSW complexity where the requirement was either unnecessary or overly stringent. Rationale statements have often been omitted or misused in spite of a best practice that calls for a rationale for every requirement. Reference (4) places great emphasis on the need to provide rationales.
<br><br/>    Although overall complexity can be reduced through engineering trade studies involving multiple stakeholders (e.g., flight, ground, hardware, software, testing, operations), Reference (3) found that trade studies were often omitted or performed superficially. 
<br><br/>    Good software architecture is the most important defense against incidental complexity in software designs, but good architecting skills are not common. 
<br><br/>    A decision is often made not to implement a FSW function, or not to fix a FSW defect, principally because an operational workaround is feasible. This practice transfers complexity from FSW to mission operations where it is a continuing cost rather than a one-time cost and where it increases the risk of an operational error. 
<br><br/>    Fault management (aka fault protection) software is among the most difficult FSW to specify, design, and test. Other fault management problems (Reference (5)) include inconsistent fault management terminology used by NASA centers and their contractors, mismatches between mission requirements and the fault management approach, and lack of attention to fault management in university curricula.
<br><br/>    Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software can provide valuable functionality, but it often comes with unneeded features that interact with other features and complicate testing. 
<br><br/>    Because software development can generate at least 1 defect per 10,000 LOC, FSW with 1 million LOC will have 100 defects, some of which will likely manifest during mission operations.  Mature software may contain latent defects that may manifest in new applications.

"314",2048,"Oberhettinger, David ","Autonomous Transfer to Reaction Wheel Control May Lead to Safing Instability","In-flight the EPOXI spacecraft exhibited a safe mode instability after a portion of the torque distribution was assigned to a reaction wheel that had been powered down. It was determined that safing assumes that all wheels are operational and does not check the power state of each wheel. It would not significantly increase flight software complexity for safing to check the status of each wheel. Safing designers should also consider avoiding reliance on a software flag to activate a set of RWAs, disabling auxiliary controllers while in safe mode, avoiding autonomous switching from thruster to RWA control, disabling unnecessary attitude control performance enhancement features while in safe mode, and scrutinizing new features that may have unintended consequences when added to heritage systems.","    A system that permits safe mode to ""use"" all four RWAs regardless of the power state of the wheels may minimize flight software complexity, but it may pose an elevated risk of unintended consequences. For EPOXI, it caused erroneous activation of auxiliary controllers.<br></br>    

The null-space and torque minimization controllers rely on a software flag for activation of a set of RWAs instead of directly interrogating each RWA on its operational state. The EPOXI anomaly demonstrated that such a flag can be inconsistent with the actual hardware available for attitude control.<br></br>    

Auxiliary controllers (e.g., the null-space and torque minimization controllers) enhance the attitude control performance of the spacecraft during nominal flight operations, but their operation is not essential to stable operation when the spacecraft is in safe mode. The controllers add a degree of unpredictability to the safing performance, and they complicate testing of the safing logic over the full range of failure scenarios.<br></br>    

During safe mode, the EPOXI flight software design mandates a transition from attitude control by thrusters back to attitude control by RWAs without review by ground controllers. This feature may have been inherited from missions that have less propellant mass margin and seek to speed the transition from thruster control to conserve propellant and maximize satellite lifespan. However, autonomous transition to wheel control introduces a plethora of possible failure modes.<br></br>    

The EPOXI flight software was derived from a heritage system that (1) lacked the capability to track the RWA hardware set that was actually active and (2) would power down a wheel in fewer fault conditions. The EPOXI FP authority to power down a wheel thus represented a new capability, and a more thorough scrub of the flight system heritage logic (defining when to use the auxiliary controllers) might have exposed the attendant risks.

Congress asked NASA to revise the redaction of the NAOMS survey data so that more information could be released. At the same time, NASA had to revise the NAOMS data presentation (called Phase 2 data) so as to protect (as much as possible) the identity of pilots who were the participants in the survey.  One particular step which NASA took in the NAOMS data release project was to perform a risk analysis. The purpose of this risk analysis was to provide a comparison of the probability of identity disclosure between the NAOMS phase 1 and phase 2 data presentation. <br/>
<br/>
The NAOMS risk analysis was a very schedule driven task to solve a unique mathematical research problem within several months. Unique, conceptual problems were involved in the development of the mathematical model. This was especially true because there were no standard predecessors for our particular problem.  The probabilities for each of the enabling events in the success-tree had a substantial amount of uncertainty ( ie. wide ranges). This is due to the fact that any of the input variables for models to estimate those probabilities would have large uncertainties. The schedule commitment by NASA to solve a problem should not be made without understanding the nature of the problem and the full resources needed (including time).","Problems such as the NAOMS risk analysis simply require the necessary time to mature the methodology and arrive at a solution. The time is required by the situation itself and is independent of schedule. We realized that premature or crude results were forced in order to meet a schedule. NASA can take the time necessary to provide a higher precision result. (To do the job correctly) The NAOMS risk analysis  is an example of the dominance of schedule compliance over technical requirements. 
<br/>Another lesson learned was that the NAOMS risk team should have challenged the project management to a far greater degree about the schedule issue. We learned an important insight in the course of the project. The probabilities for each of the enabling events in the success-tree had a substantial amount of uncertainty. ( ie. wide ranges)  This is due to the fact that any of the input variables for models to estimate those probabilities would have large uncertainties.

NAOMS is a survey-based data collection system designed to collect aviation safety data from general aviation and air carrier pilots. NAOMS was designed to quantify aviation safety events and other safety-relevant phenomena. Because incidents posing a threat to aviation safety are relatively rare events, useful analysis requires the acquisition of a large, statistically meaningful database that is representative of the system.  These data can be used to identify system-wide trends and establish performance measures with emphasis on tracking the effects of safety interventions (new procedures, technologies, and training) on national aviation safety levels.

The survey-based project team offered anonymity to those taking part in the survey, and one of the contractors responsibilities was to anonymize the data set.  
<br/>
<br/>Data collection using the methodology began in April 2001 and ended in December 2004, during which time the project team conducted approximately 24,000 surveys of commercial airline pilots and approximately 5,000 general aviation pilots.   Research conducted in the NAOMS project, including the survey methodology, had not been peer-reviewed and should not be viewed or considered as having been validated.
<br/>","Most statistical agencies (e.g. Census Bureau) are governed by the Confidentiality Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act (CIPSEA) of 2002 when releasing confidential information is at issue. CIPSEA requires all federal agencies to protect data or information acquired by the agency under a pledge of confidentiality for exclusively statistical purposes from being disclosed in identifiable form. The NASA Office of the General Counsel determined that CIPSEA does not apply to the NAOMS information collection.  For purposes of CIPSEA, NASA is considered a non-statistical agency.  As a non-statistical agency, the information collection must be conducted by civil servants to have CIPSEA apply.  During the NAOMS project, contractors collected survey information.  Also, in order to have CIPSEA protection, there is a specific &quot;confidentiality pledge&quot; that comes directly from the statute.  This pledge was not read to the NAOMS participants. The bottom-line is that CIPSEA does not apply to NAOMS. Also, allowing another statistical agency, who has CIPSEA coverage, to archive and distribute the raw data to qualified identities, will not further protect the NAOMS data.
<br/>
<br/>The very best approach to an aviation survey and data base project would be to have it conducted by a statistical agency of the US Government. This would also allow the establishment of a Research Data Center under the strict control of the statistical agency. Under such rules, even the raw survey data could be used by researchers without any redaction. The research would have to be performed by the researchers in Washington DC, on the premises of the statistical agency and under their rules, constraints, and supervision.  No expensive redaction project would be needed and confidentiality could be assured. 
<br/>
<br/>The concept of a Research Data Center is a means to secure facilities designed for outside researchers to access confidential agency data. Several statistical federal agencies (e.g. Census Bureau) have instituted the concept of a Research Data Center with much success.  Access to the NAOMS raw survey responses would be under defined criteria and confidentiality conditions.  The Research Data Center could be established within NASA or through sponsorship from a statistical agency already equipped with the infrastructure to share, control, and monitor the use of confidential survey responses. 
<br/>
<br/>Under the concept of a Research Data Center, an interested party would submit a request or proposal to NASA for the use of NAOMS raw survey responses. The proposal would be evaluated for merit, NASA mission related interests, and the requesters ability to maintain confidentiality. Upon acceptance of the proposal, the requester would agree to the terms of use of the raw survey responses, including the confidentiality requirements.  Any products created with, or from, the use of the raw survey responses would be provided to NASA before its publication and release. The Research Data Center provides the framework to allow individuals or organizations with proven capabilities to analyze the NAOMS survey responses with minimal cost to NASA.

NAOMS is a survey-based data collection system designed to collect aviation safety data from general aviation and air carrier pilots. NAOMS was designed to quantify aviation safety events and other safety-relevant phenomena. Because incidents posing a threat to aviation safety are relatively rare events, useful analysis requires the acquisition of a large, statistically meaningful database that is representative of the system.  These data can be used to identify system-wide trends and establish performance measures with emphasis on tracking the effects of safety interventions (new procedures, technologies, and training) on national aviation safety levels.  The NAOMS project selected a contractor to develop a survey methodology to acquire such data.

"361",1799,"Oberhettinger, David ","Erroneous Onboard Status Reporting Disabled IMAGE's Radio","The loss of the IMAGE satellite was attributed to a Single Event Upset-induced ""instant trip"" of the Solid State Power Controller (SSPC) that supplies power to the single-string Transponder. The circuit breaker was not reset because this hybrid device incorrectly reported the circuit breaker as closed, and ground could not command a reset because the satellite's single telemetry receiver had been disabled by the SSPC. The SSPC's problematic state reporting characteristic was an intentional design feature that was not reflected in any part documentation, and three similar ""instant trips"" on other NASA satellites had not been reported in the GIDEP system. Consider hardwiring receiver power to the power bus, or build redundancy into the power switching or into the operational status sensing. Ensure that GIDEP reports or NASA Alerts are written and routed to mission operations (as well as to hardware developers), and that flight software responds to command loss with a set of timed spacecraft-level fault responses.","  



  The ability to switch a transponder on and off, especially when a smart device replaces a fused supply, provides flexibility during spacecraft integration and test, and facilitates a mission design in which the transponder is OFF during ascent. However, the IMAGE mishap may validate the typical industry-wide practice of minimizing the risk of losing uplink telemetry by hardwiring the receiver to the power bus.
<br><br>  

  Overcurrent protection of a spacecraft receiver may actually pose a mission-critical risk unless the protection device is designed to reset (in a robust and redundant manner) after transient faults in either the receiver or the overcurrent protection device itself.
<br><br>  

  Had the IMAGE PDU EDAC designers known in advance about the SSPC's status reporting limitation, they could have designed the logic to prevent an unrecoverable loss of receiver power. For example, it could have imposed a transponder voltage test that closed the SSPC after an extended voltage drop. Also, NASA part anomaly alerts are typically distributed only to hardware developers; distribution to operations personnel would allow early consideration of possible mitigation action.
<br><br>
  

  
Protection against the loss of ground commanding was needed at the flight system level. A system-level command loss fault response from the flight software in IMAGE's main computer that reached to the root level (i.e., including the SSPC) would have reset the telecom power supply SSPC as well as reasserting attitude control and other subsystem and system functions. ""Command loss fault protection"" typically resets its timer periodically over the course of normal operations; after the flight software loses ground commanding (for whatever reason), the fault protection will (after a period of days or months) cycle through different system configurations and options until contact is restored.

Hence, the plans called for 50 percent of the launched dry mass of MER to derive from detailed designs inherited from the 1997 Mars Pathfinder design. However, design studies showed this to be impractical, and only 2 percent of the MER dry mass was actually derived from inherited designs.<br><br>  
  	A typical 4-year development cycle was compressed into 3 years for a very complex and volume-constrained spacecraft. This period encompassed repetitive redesign and test cycles for the parachutes and airbags, and the addition only 18 months before launch of  a capability to directly sense horizontal motion across the Martian surface (Reference (2)).<br><br>  
  	A non-essential fuse blown during a test pyrotechnic firing only two months before MER launch produced an unexpected circuit condition. Consequently, it appeared that mission-critical sneak circuit paths could result from the mission sequence in which a cable-cutter severs spacecraft power bus return wires that are not electrically isolated (deadfaced). One month of intensive circuit analysis by a group of very senior engineers proved that MER could safely launch.<br><br>  
  	Only 48 hours before the MER landing, an analysis of testbed data suggested an apparent timing problem with the pyrotechnic system electronics that trigger the landing events. Around-the-clock analysis over the next day confirmed a mission-critical hardware design flaw, and JPL made a risky decision to manually enable the firing of the pyros that may have saved the mission.

"368",1795,"Curtis, Leslie ","NASA Mishap Investigation Report Review, application to LRO and LCROSS","One of NASAs earliest activities for implementing the vision for space exploration is the initiation of a series of robotic missions to the moon to prepare for and support future human exploration activities.  The Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) is sponsoring two robotic missions to the moon in late 2008.  The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) will spend at least one year in low, polar orbit gathering data to map the lunar surface.  LRO will collect the highest resolution and most comprehensive data set ever returned from the moon to help achieve NASAs goal of returning human explorers safely to the moon.  The Lunar Crater Observations and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) will investigate the presence and nature of water ice on the moon by impacting a lunar crater and observing the ejecta plume created. The LCROSS mission will provide valuable information about the existence of water on the moon, which will be used for future human lunar mission designs.
<br/>
<br/>To help ensure the success of these two important missions, an assessment of previous NASA missions which had mishaps or failures was performed.  Mishap Investigation Board (MIB) Reports were reviewed for eight missions, and the root causes and contributing causes of these mission mishaps were organized into recurring areas or themes.  The recurring causes for these mishaps were reviewed with emphasis on potential application to LRO and LCROSS.  It is hoped that this assessment of past missions that experienced mishaps and failures will prove valuable to the LRO and LCROSS project teams.
<br/>","The goal for NASA is to achieve mission success in all of its projects and programs.  To accomplish this goal proven engineering and design processes must be used, accompanied by adequate reviews and a healthy test and verification program.  Risks must be constantly assessed and accounted for during implementation of the project.  NASA has accomplished many missions successfully and there have also been quite a number of mission mishaps which could have been avoided.

"401",5776,"Unknown","Mission Collaborations for International Projects","The Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) routinely partners with International organizations building spacecraft or instruments for launching on foreign vehicles or vice versa. GSFC built an X-ray Spectrometer (XRS) which was incorporated into a Japanese spacecraft, Astro E-2, which was launched on a Japanese vehicle. Astro E-2 was actually the repeat of the failed Astro E mission in which the launch vehicle failed to make orbit. Interestingly, Astro E was deemed a success even though XRS was never operated on orbit and was the rationale behind adopting a –build to print” approach for Astro E-2. That is, use the same drawings and design approach as the original Astro E build with little or no changes. Astro E-2 made it to orbit and was renamed Suzaku as is Japanese custom. Unfortunately both Astro E and Astro E-2 had the same flaw which failed the Astro E-2 and would have failed Astro E had its launch been successful. The fatal design flaw that originated in the Astro E spacecraft was propagated to the Astro E-2 spacecraft was found to be the single proximate cause for this mishap but the underlying root causes are complex and intertwined which were enabled by the nature of the unsound approach to the inter- organizational collaborative effort.","From the Astro E-2 MIB: NASA and ISAS did not develop a common approach to project management, joint mission level reviews with shared understanding of those reviews, configuration management, interface control documents, systems integration, and project management standards. The Suzaku team failed to create a mission-level review process that allowed the full participation of both partners, partly due to language and cultural barriers (as is Japanese tradition missions are renamed upon launch). Design reviews were primarily conducted in Japanese; GSFC had no in-plant representative; the provisions of a Letter of Agreement (LOA) were not implemented; and of the seven ICDs generated only two were approved and the approval signatories were all GSFC personnel, Japanese concurrence was never documented. The board also believed that the –build to print” approach compromised the collaborations, as well as the design review process for Astro E-2. The reviews were neither thorough nor incisive, perhaps due to the assumed success of Astro E. When the absence of some required approved ICDs was noted during the investigation, the Critical Design Review (CDR) chair replied, ”There is no need for ICDs, itês already built?” Thus, GSFC did not have sufficient interaction with the ISAS partner in the areas of project management and system engineering at the mission and integrated instrument levels. Specifically,

  No GSFC XRS instrument manager or system engineer was appointed. GSFC was, in reality, in charge of only the helium insert portion of XRS and supporting electronics, and not the entire instrument.    

     Mission-level reviews were conducted in Japanese, with the exception of GSFC-specific portions. The Institute of Space and Astronautical  Science (ISAS) Critical Design Review had no NASA participants and the JAXA/ISAS major reliability review (called Soutenken) had no NASA participation.  

     No joint systems, subsystem, test, or operations engineering working groups were put in place.  
     NASA was not involved in mission-level Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA).    </ul>

ISAS and GSFC did not adequately plan and rehearse mission operations. Specifically,    The Suzaku team departed from normal practices in that mission-critical operationsãfor example, the irreversible opening of the He and Ne vents and valve V12), and the (planned) opening of the aperture gate valveãwere performed for the first time in flight with little rehearsal or analysis.       The Board could find no evidence that the ISAS/GSFC team conducted any operations contingency planning.   </ul>

When planning any mission a cohesive, coherent, and effective approach should be implemented and communicated to all of the parties involved. Organizational responsibilities and interfaces need to be defined and maintained throughout the projectês life cycle. This is particularly true for International missions where there are inherent geographic, cultural and communication barriers and ITAR requirements that must be overcome. Many GSFC-managed projects/organizations built by domestic contractors station project personnel in-house to monitor the build/integration. Astro E-2 chose not to place personnel in-house for the integration in Japan.","GSFC",2005-10-26,"Science, Space Operations, ",FALSE,"Integration and Testing, Manufacturing and Assembly, Cryogenic Systems, Flight Operations, Spacecraft, Test & Verification, Spacecraft and Spacecraft Instruments, Mission operations systems, Organizational Planning, Program level review processes, Science integration, Early requirements and standards definition, Product Assurance, Review systems and boards, ",421,15,"Integration and Testing","https://nen.nasa.gov/web/11/viewall/-/viewall/5776"

"423",1565,"Winterlin, Ronald ","Earned-Value Management"," The Agency has aggressively committed to pursue performance tracking such as Earned Value Management (EVM).  However, given the constraints of operating within the restrictions and limitations of a government agency, EVM can be very difficult and in some situations impossible to attain.  The Advanced Air Transportation Technologies (AATT) Project made a serious attempt to implement EVM and both ATMSDI contractors reported monthly EVM status to the AATT Project Office.  Additionally, the Project Office hired an EVM subject matter expert and attempted to track EVM utilizing in-house civil service labor plans and acturals.  This was prior to implementation of an Agency-wide generic full cost accounting system.  The AATT effort proved to be labor intensive and would have required creation of over 100 individual job order (account) numbers in the Ames financial system alone in order to accurately capture and track individual task level work plans and actuals.  In fact, Ames' financial management organization did not react favorably to the prospect of so many cost accounts for a number of reasons (additional workload being one).  Without the necessary level of detail in collecting planned and actual expenses, Earned Value Management effectiveness becomes severely compromised.  The AATT Project found that the level of information gained did not justify the workload placed on the task leads and/or PIs or the AATT Systems Management Staff.  
      
    The overall lesson learned is that if Earned Value is to be effective, Center and Agency foundations in terms of accounting systems, resources (both financial and human), tools, and cultures need to be supportive and made fully available.  
      
     ","(Specific lessons from the AATT Project's attempt at EVM)  
  
1. Within the Control of the Project:  
  a. Project formulation needs to start with a detailed project Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) to identify the work packages to be tracked.  
  b. The WBS must be developed with as much detail as possible.  It should not be constrained from the beginning based on the level of tracking capability or other accounting system restrictions.  
  c. The level of tracking can be than the level of planning detail, not vice versa.  
  d. Progress needs to be measured at levels low enough to provide accurate information, yet this may be at levels lower than currently planned.  
  e. Activities, objectives, exit criteria, deliverables and performance measures need to be identified early and documented with as much detail as possible.  One cannot measure progress if one does not know what they are trying to achieve.  
  f. Each work package to be tracked must have a separate funding cost account to enable the Actual Cost of Work Planned (ACWP) earned value metric to be calculated.  
  g. Quantifiable, objective measures of work package progress are often better than subjective estimates of percent complete, yet they cost more to identify and regularly measure.  
  
2. Outside the Controls of the Project:  
  a. Project managers need to be provided with reliable labor and overhead rates for each civil servant employee working on the project in order to accurately capture civil servant costs.  
  b. A projectès earned value system should not have to account for or be held accountable for, organizational taxes or Center taxes, which do not directly contribute to the satisfaction of project objectives.  
  c. Performing organizations must task both their in-house and out-of-house contractors within the work package structure such that the contractor expenditures can be tracked to specific guidelines as they work.  
  d. Frequency of re-base lining the plans is dependent upon outside influences such as availability and stability of resources provided versus planned.  Congressional budget cuts, earmarks, etc. will force re-base lining.  
  e. Frequency of re-base lining may be dependent upon having stable requirements, many of which may be provided from outside the project.  For example, the AATT Project supports requirements of the FAA.  The FAA often changes these requirements, which then impact the AATT Project plans.","ARC",2005-06-07,"Aeronautics Research, Science, Exploration Systems, Space Operations, ",FALSE,"",444,24,NA,"https://nen.nasa.gov/web/11/viewall/-/viewall/1565"
"424",1568,"Winterlin, Ronald ","Sub-project Management Authority"," Key subordinate project management positions must be truly accountable to the Project Manager. Sub-project managers must be empowered to manage and make decisions pertaining to their element of the project. Roles, responsibilities and authority of SP managers should be agreed to by line and project management and formally documented up front. The sub-project managers should be recognized as having the appropriate management authority necessary to make key decisions in both the direction of the work and the funding required to accomplish it. The AATT Project is perspective is that ideally such key positions as sub-project managers should report directly to the project manager. Any agreements and arrangements for matrix organizational support must be carefully thought out, documented and communicated to all involved organizations including management (all levels) and those responsible to do the work. Special attention should be given to assure this support is indeed provided through the life of the project and that continuity is maintained when personnel inevitably turnover. AATT experienced a significant amount of key position turnovers and in some instances new managers reinvented the wheel which has an effect on all support staff impacting overall effectiveness and efficiency.  
     "," Without proper authority and accountability to appropriate line management, the efficiency and effectiveness of individual subordinate support managers is significantly diminished. This can have a detrimental and even disruptive effect both on day-to-day work and ability to achieve successful project milestones and deliverables on time and on schedule.

"425",1566,"Winterlin, Ronald ","External Relations, Customers, and Technology Transfer"," Most all projects in today's environment invariably require the cooperation and support of multiple organizations both in development and acceptance of project deliverables (including multiple government agencies, the project's customers, educational institutions and potential industry stakeholders and users).  With resources scarce at all levels and close oversight and scrutiny (both internally and externally), the importance of the inevitable matrix organizations established to carry out programs and projects from formulation through implementation cannot be overemphasized.  
      
    The Advanced Air Transportation Technologies (AATT) Project made a significant effort in communicating and developing agreements with key partners such as the FAA, as a primary receiver/user of the Project's products.  A multitude of Memorandum of Understanding/Agreements, etc., were established and utilized during the life of this project.  Clearly, the partnership with the FAA proved to be the Project's greatest challenge.  
      
    With continuous management and organizational changes at all levels, policy and procedure changes, etc., AATT experienced problems, as grouped and summarized below:  
      
    A. Interacting with, and learning to work with an entirely different federal agency such as the FAA: It took much time and resources to experience and understand key cultural and organizational differences involving everything from policy, procedures, politics, and communication processes in both technical and administrative/management domains.  Comments at all levels across the AATT Project demonstrate that this was one of the most significant ongoing challenges.  The FAA failed for a number of reasons to provide consistent single points of contact (POC) for any appreciable length of time.  One manager reports that the average life of an FAA POC has been less than 2 years.  Also, unexpected union issues and concerns ensued with the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) and the Professional Airways Systems Specialists (PASS), which were increased since AATT had a presence at more than one FAA facility.  To further complicate things, continual shifts and/or reorganizations within the FAA resulted in AATT technology being moved from organization to organization constantly requiring NASA managers and researchers to educate and establish relationships with new FAA personnel.  
      
    B. Resource Support: As the AATT Project matured, FAA commitments to provide joint support funding, personnel and/or facilities declined for a number of reasons.  AATT learned the high risk this really is from the start and how it can lead to de-scoping, schedule delays or tradeoffs not originally foreseen.  
      
    C. Technical Transfer of Project Products: AATT invested much time and energy in working with a number of FAA POCs at various levels to establish an agreed upon process and understanding of technologies to be passed on for further development and implementation into the National Airspace System (NAS).  The FAA has stated that they are often unprepared for the research NASA develops that they are then expected to further develop and implement into the operational environment.  The AATT tailored TRL (Technology Readiness Level) process has been used for these purposes. An ongoing problem AATT has experienced is the FAA's desire and need to know how a newly developed NASA technology being handed over, will fit into the evolving NAS.  
      
    D. External Agreements and Management Support: As indicated above, the AATT Project was subjected to much instability and organizational dynamics in its relationship to the FAA.  Formal agreements that were made and in place between the FAA and the AATT Project regarding technologies to be prototyped, demonstrated, and transferred in support of stakeholder requirements were ignored.  In light of this, it is crucial to gain long-term top-level management support from any and all key participating organizations including necessary resource commitments.  
      
     "," For all of the above listed examples, the importance of establishing strong up-front relationships and communications between all levels of management authority down to working collaborations cannot be overemphasized.  This is especially important when two large federal agencies are involved that must work successfully together to research and develop complex technical concepts and tools that must be passed from one to the other for implementation into the operational systems of the real world.

"426",1571,"Winterlin, Ronald ","Streamlining and Standardizing Project Planning Documents (prepared during formulation and into implementation phases)"," Advanced Air Transportation Technologies (AATT) was a nine-year effort and experienced significant changes in documentation requirements from Headquarters and the lead center.  This had an effect on the policies, procedures, formats, and content for project planning and formulation documents including the program, project and sub-project plans (or IBPDs), along with related other agreements and supportive plans (e.g. Program Commitment Agreements, Risk Management/Mitigation Plans, Tech Transfer Plans, etc.).  Examples include everything from title and formatting changes to basic content requirements including the program and project Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).  
      
    The WBS continues to be a key tool that is recognized as being one of the most important basic building blocks around which a program and project(s) should be developed.  Its potential for being the central structure, providing the basis for successful financial and Earned Value management and control, along with project metrics, technical and performance tracking, and schedule development cannot be denied.  AATT experienced confusing and sometimes unclear guidance regarding the best way to develop a WBS for projects focused on concept exploration and development and demonstration.  Both NASA and the private sector training provide theory and emphasize the key role and importance of a good WBS, but do not provide hands-on real world applications and assistance in creating a WBS for these types of projects.  The various types of WBS formats and approaches are offered (e.g., organizational versus product versus work, etc.), but clear guidance as to real world applications for the best approach and how to do it, within the constraints and limitations of the NASA financial management system and full cost accounting, is lacking.  
      
     "," Much time and resources are wasted when disruptive top-level requirements are passed down without clear guidance as to what is really required that will satisfy future reviews and decision gates.  When this guidance is continually changed due to changes in managers who set them, it adds to the waste of time and resources.

"429",1574,"Winterlin, Ronald ","Stability of Project Technical Content/Focus and Milestone Creep"," A number of times, the AATT Project was directed to add, delete, and/or change the project focus of research, not only on existing agreed-to ATM products (tools and concepts), but in some cases, change of direction to develop totally new tools. It is understood that flexibility in research must be maintained in order that concepts that do not prove worthwhile can be dropped allowing for focus and priority shifts to more promising ones. However, both realistic and reasonable controls on project scope and priority setting must be maintained to assure prudent management planning and decision-making. Excessive control and redirection of focus/priorities late into a project's life leads to wasteful use of resources and hampers the project's ability to manage and deliver effectively. Significant changes well into the implementation phase can be very costly as contractual planning and funds obligations limit the scope and/or task requirement changes that can bemade after the fact.  
      
    Directly related to the above is what we refer to as milestone creep. Project management shifts, along with changing (sometimes mandated) project priorities, resulted in too many milestones that grew in number all the way into the last trimester of the project. This also made it difficult to adhere to a uniform, consistent milestone organization and management system, resulting in some sub-projects with many more milestones and resultant work than others and the milestones becoming somewhat jumbled and not following the most logical sequencing. This caused a significant amount of work to support programmatic/administrative management, documentation and configuration control, tracking, etc. across organizations (including 3 centers and multiple directorates and divisions).  
      
     "," It is easy to lose sight of the big picture and overall historical evolution with continual guidance to change direction/focus and/or project deliverables and related milestones.

It is understood that flexibility in research must be maintained in order that concepts that do not prove worthwhile can be dropped allowing for focus and priority shifts to more promising ones.  However, both realistic and reasonable controls on project scope and priority setting must be maintained to assure prudent management planning and decision-making.  Excessive control and redirection of focus/priorities late into a project's life leads to wasteful use of resources and hampers the project's ability to manage and deliver effectively.  Significant changes well into the implementation phase can be very costly as contractual planning and funds obligations limit the scope and/or task requirement changes that can bemade after the fact.  
      
    Directly related to the above is what we refer to as milestone creep.  Project management shifts, along with changing (sometimes mandated) project priorities, resulted in too many milestones that grew in number all the way into the last trimester of the project.  This also made it difficult to adhere to a uniform, consistent milestone organization and management system, resulting in some sub-projects with many more milestones and resultant work than others and the milestones becoming somewhat jumbled and not following the most logical sequencing.

    This document presents several lessons learned and recommendations for proactive measures to prevent a recurrence of this unfortunate accident. They may be considered applicable to any government/contractor collaborative relationship established to build, test, and launch space flight hardware. The lessons learned relate to the Integration and Test (I&amp;T) phase of the satellite development life cycle and are particularly relevant to long duration projects.  
      
     ","The lessons learned in the NOAA-N Prime mishap are listed below. They are not profound; they are all obvious. The accident occurred because a long duration program that had experienced several years of high performance success grew complacent, both at the government and at the contractor. The rules were relaxed, shortcuts were taken, product assurance grew sloppy, and proper oversight was not applied. The recommended actions are equally straightforward. Obey the rules, follow the procedures proactively, train the team, always consider systems safety, and provide effective independent oversight.  
      
    In order to emphasize specific points, ten lessons are identified. The lessons are not independent, stand alone items. All are interrelated facets of the overall NOAA-N Prime mishap lesson which is to perform I&amp;T and I&amp;T oversight diligently.

    The NOAA-N Prime lessons learned are applicable to spacecraft development contractors and to the government organizations that hold the contracts. Under most NASA prime contracts, the spacecraft vendors are wholly responsible for the development of the satellite. The existence of government representatives who monitor contractor performance does not relieve the contractor of their end item responsibilities. However, since the independent assurance value of government oversight is diminished unless it is rigorously applied, most of the recommendations in this document address both the contractor and the government.   
      
    Each lesson learned is described below followed by the recommendation for that lesson.   
      
      

    1. Past success does not guarantee current performance</br>
  
    Lessons Learned:   
      
    The NOAA-N Prime accident occurred after three intense and productive years on the spacecraft contract. Work completed during those three years included two successful launches (NOAA-L in September 2000, NOAA-M in June 2002), dynamics testing of NOAA-N (NOAA-N is a different satellite than NOAA-N Prime), thermal vacuum testing of NOAA-N, dynamics testing of NOAA-N Prime and thermal vacuum testing of NOAA-N Prime. Because so much had been accomplished over an extended period, both the government and the contractor were lulled into believing that this high performance level was normal and would be sustained on its own. It was assumed that I&amp;T operations were being conducted in compliance with requirements. It was assumed that contractor and government oversight provided the necessary checks and balances. The contractor and the NASA project office considered the NOAA-N Prime spacecraft tilt operation scheduled for September 6, 2003 as routine because numerous tilts had been performed. Neither the government nor the contractor worried about I&amp;T operations on a Saturday because I&amp;T had been performed six days a week for years on the program. The accident caught everyone by surprise; no one saw it coming. The government and the contractor were overconfident and complacent based on past successes.   
      
    The lesson learned is that successful performance in the past does not predict success in the future, especially on long duration projects. Even the most extraordinary effort in the past does not guarantee that future efforts will be sustained at the same high quality level. Proactive measures must be taken to maintain a highly functional I&amp;T environment. This necessitates leadership to guard against complacency and take action against it, discipline and enforcement.   
      
    Formal guidelines are needed to regulate I&amp;T. Each spacecraft operation must be planned in advance, even if it has been performed many times. The I&amp;T test procedures must be correct and clearly written. Each team member must be trained in his responsibilities. The correct make up of the I&amp;T crew by skill mix and the required independent verifiers must be present for each operation. Strict discipline must be enforced on the I&amp;T floor. Stamping policy must be enforced, procedure steps should not be bought off unless personally performed or witnessed. System safety must be everyone&raquo;s concern. Operations planned for weekends require the full I&amp;T team, just as any other day of the week. The procedures must be rigorously followed during execution. The managers should permit no shortcuts regardless of the number of times an operation has been performed. Even if the I&amp;T crew is completely familiar with the operation and had performed it successfully many time
    before, procedure execution discipline must be maintained. It is essential that the government members of the I&amp;T team follow the same rules as the contractor or else the value of independent oversight is severely reduced.   
      

     2. Periodically update generic NASA contract requirements on long duration contracts  
      
    Lessons Learned:  
      
    Overall NASA requirements, standards, and guidelines for space flight hardware development are incrementally improved and evolve over time to incorporate advances in aerospace engineering and management practices. Applicable requirements are imposed on NASA contracts at contract start in order to improve the satellite design, manufacturing, and test process to the most current requirements, standards, and guidelines. This lesson learned refers to these general standards and requirements, such as EEE parts control and spacecraft orbital debris analysis, not contract unique requirements like satellite or instrument specifications.   
      
    The spacecraft contract was 15 years old at the time of the NOAA-N Prime accident. The contract was not initially planned to be that long, but additional satellites including NOAA-N Prime were added after 6 years, extending the performance period. Many of the contract requirements had not been changed since the contract started. Deliverable plans were submitted and approved in the first year of the contract and then, for the most part, archived and rarely referenced. For example, the contractor&raquo;s System Safety Implementation Plan was delivered in the 1980s and never updated in spite of three corporate turnovers and change in the location of the satellite manufacturing plant in 1998 from the East Coast to the West Coast. The contract&raquo;s system safety requirements related mainly to launch site safety, which was the main NASA safety emphasis at the time the contract started in 1988. Since then, NASA has significantly expanded system safety requirements to apply throughout the spacecraft development life cycle. But, the NOAA-N Prime contractor was not asked to update the System Safety Implementation Plan.  
      
    The lesson learned is that long duration contracts should be periodically (perhaps every 5 years) reviewed by the responsible government organization to ensure that the generic NASA requirements are up to date. If they do not meet current NASA policy relevant to the contract, the contracts should be modified to add the new requirements, or delete items no longer needed. The new requirements must first be reviewed to determine that they are applicable to the contract, not all new requirements should be automatically added. Examples of new requirements are IT security, specific system engineering analysis tools, risk management requirements, new releases of applicable documents, and independent review requirements. Implementing new requirements will add cost to the contract, so budget needs to be allocated for this purpose.  
      
    Plans that were submitted early after contract start should be reviewed periodically by the contractor and the government to determine whether they need updating. These plans describe how a function, such as configuration management or software management, will be performed during contract execution. Plans may need updating because implementations can change over time due to things such as company internal requirements changes, contract requirements changes, organizational changes, new technologies applied, and corporate mergers. The review and update process will add cost to the contract, so budget needs to be allocated for this purpose.  
      
    Major aerospace contractors have their own corporate requirements, standards, and policies that are imposed on all the work performed by the company. The companies should, on their own initiative, review their contracted work periodically to ensure that their corporate requirements are being fulfilled.  
      

    3. Conduct periodic training in I&amp;T roles and responsibilities  
      
    Lessons Learned:  
      
    Experience in I&amp;T does not eliminate the need for training as the NOAA-N Prime mishap demonstrated. The I&amp;T team on the floor at the time of the accident was comprised entirely of experienced workers on the NOAA satellites. In spite of their experience, they did not correctly perform their jobs on the day of the accident. The instrument shimming operation planned for the day of the mishap had been hurriedly put together; the test procedure was scissored out of existing procedures without a clear top level road map. The Responsible Test Engineer (RTE) did not have the full I&amp;T team present as required by the test procedure on the day of the accident, but he proceeded anyway. System safety engineering was not called to participate in the operation as required by the procedure for a hazardous operation, so no safety engineering representative was present when the tilt began. The government quality representative was called and he gave verbal permission to start without
    him. He was not present when the tilt began. The test procedure statement about assuring the configuration of the turn over cart was ambiguous. The RTE did not physically examine the configuration of the turn over cart, because he had used it a few weeks earlier on NOAA-N, and relied on paper logs to verify the configuration. (Unknown to the RTE, bolts securing the adapter plate had been removed from the cart since he had last used it.) A member of the I&amp;T team questioned the cart configuration but the RTE, without examining the cart, told him that the cart was configured correctly.   
      
    The lesson learned is self evident: experience in I&amp;T is not enough, the I&amp;T team must perform their work correctly and they need to know what is expected of them. Training is needed to instruct the I&amp;T team how to perform their work properly. Each member of the team, including the government and company quality witnesses, must understand their job and their roles around high value flight hardware. Lead test conductors must be certified to have the appropriate qualifying experience as well as the supervisory discipline and training needed to assume responsibility for the flight hardware. The Responsible Test Engineer must understand that procedures must be followed; the proper I&amp;T crew, product assurance, safety, government monitors must be present; and hazardous operations need special care. The product assurance representatives must understand their roles as witnesses and they must be trained to not buy off procedure steps unless they have personally witnessed
    them.Everyone needs to be concerned about the safety of people and high value flight hardware. If any member of the team has a question or a doubt, it should be investigated, not dismissed. Each member of the team should be empowered to halt an operation. Organizational practices must be established to reinforce the role and responsibility of contractor and government inspectors as independent verification agents.   
      
    Long duration contracts and/or contracts for multiple satellites need extra attention. While there are advantages to being familiar with the spacecraft and the I&amp;T process, training must also address how to keep the workers mentally engaged given the repetitive nature of some I&amp;T work. Complacency must be avoided. Each operation must be carefully planned and executed, regardless of how many times it was run before.  
      
    Training cannot be learned solely in a classroom setting. It should include various venues such as discussion groups, lectures, on line training, use of hardware and software simulators, documentation, mentoring, and on the job training by watching experienced personnel. Training should also include stories of how things went wrong on other projects with the lesson being: it could happen to us.   
      
    Training is not a one-time activity. It must be a continual proactive process, a constant admonition to work correctly. The I&amp;T team must be repeatedly reminded of their responsibilities and everyone needs to take it seriously. Program training and need dates for refresher training should be tracked. Certifications must be regularly renewed.  
      
    Contractor product assurance personnel need additional training in quality assurance and safety. The requirement for their independent verification function must be repeatedly emphasized. Stamping policy must be enforced. Quality should not buy off procedure steps without witnessing them. Similarly, government quality personnel need training in their oversight responsibilities.  
      
    Supervisors should receive additional training in the management of I&amp;T personnel. Supervisors must take an active role in monitoring the performance of their employees. If any employees are not meeting the requirements, the supervisors must arrange for further training or other appropriate corrective actions. Poor performance cannot be tolerated. Supervisors must always follow the requirements in their own work and be a role model for their employees.  
      
    The training and certification program must include emphasis on team roles and responsibilities. Good communication among all team members is essential while planning and executing I&amp;T operations. The government and the contractor should work together to define roles of each member of the I&amp;T team, including the government team. Contractor roles include the test conductor, technicians, engineering, systems safety, and quality engineering. If NASA has delegated specific product assurance functions to the Defense Contract Management Agency and NASA has also retained some independent quality oversight responsibilities, the respective functions must be clarified to the contractor so that the right people can be notified prior to the I&amp;T operation. The in-plant government I&amp;T team members should participate in the same training as the contractors, as well as additional training defined by DCMA and NASA.   
      
    The training program should be carefully developed to focus on the problem areas. Too much training may be counterproductive. When training becomes overkill, people may actually pay less attention. Training must be appropriate in both quantity and content in order to be effective.   
      

    4. Effective safety program is essential  
      
    Lessons Learned:  
      
    System safety did not receive high priority at the contractor or the responsible government organization prior to the NOAA-N Prime accident. System safety was not fully integrated into the I&amp;T team. System safety representatives were not contacted by the I&amp;T team on the day of the accident to witness the hazardous NOAA-N Prime tilt operation as required by the procedure. Hence, there was no safety expert present on the I&amp;T floor at the time of the accident. Government safety was mainly concerned with launch site safety and not with the day-to-day operations at Sunnyvale. Before the accident, there was insufficient safety support on the program both at the contractor&raquo;s site and in the responsible government organization.  
      
    Safety of personnel and flight hardware is a serious matter and should be priority one. Safety support must not be tailored to resources available. An effective system safety program is needed at both the government and the contractor to protect people from injury and to keep high value flight hardware secure. Every member of the contractor and the government team needs to understand that safety is everyone&raquo;s responsibility. The contractor&raquo;s safety program should meet current safety requirements. Safety related training should be provided to all contractor and government team members. Satellite development contractors need to have system safety involved in every step of the satellite life cycle. Enough safety engineers must be assigned to the project to perform the necessary work; safety engineering should not be a part time function drawn from a centralized corporate safety engineering pool. Safety engineers should participate in satellite design, manufacturing and
    I&amp;T. Safety engineers should be involved with the design of flight hardware and ground support equipment to make them as safe as possible, participate in materials and parts selection, evaluate manufacturing techniques for compliance with safety requirements, perform hazard analysis, determine which I&amp;T operations are safety critical and how to best execute them, perform operational hazard analysis, witness hazardous I&amp;T operations to ensure that all safety precautions have been taken, document launch site safety issues, and keep up with aerospace safety engineering practices. I&amp;T operations must not proceed without safety representatives present when documented in procedural requirements. The contractor must rigorously adhere to safety requirements.   
      
    The government must have a strong system safety program with sufficient safety engineers to oversee the contractor&raquo;s safety implementation. The government&raquo;s system safety program must implement up to date NASA safety policy, and impose them on the contractor. The government&raquo;s safety program must work closely with the contractor to monitor their performance and review safety related deliverable documentation. The government&raquo;s safety engineers must provide safety training to the government staff. Government safety should perform safety audits periodically to evaluate the contractor&raquo;s critical processes and procedures.  
      

    5. Handling flight hardware is never routine  
      
    Lessons Learned:  
      
    Special care must always be taken when handling high value flight hardware. Regardless of how many times a particular I&amp;T operation has been performed, focused attention is required when a critical or hazardous operation is performed. The NOAA-N Prime accident occurred when a hazardous operation was treated as routine, a short handed I&amp;T crew was working, and the procedures were not followed. The Responsible Test Engineer felt that the turn over cart was properly configured because he had used it a few weeks earlier on NOAA-N which he verified by checking the paperwork. He did not actually examine the cart as required by procedure. Had he looked at the cart matched against the drawing, he should have noticed the missing bolts from the adapter plate. The bolts are large and clearly visible when properly installed. Even when one of the technicians questioned the cart&raquo;s configuration, the RTE did not look at the cart. In this case, handling the flight hardware and
    using the turn over cart was considered so ordinary by the RTE, that he did not bother to physically look at the ground equipment on which he planned to rotate a fully assembled satellite.   
      
    Rules should be developed by the government and the contractor on how to conduct I&amp;T. Each I&amp;T operation should be fully planned in advance with system safety as the paramount concern. I&amp;T procedures must be developed to control and guide the proper handling of flight hardware and these must be followed during I&amp;T operations. I&amp;T procedures must be clearly written, those that contain hazardous operations must be clearly marked on the document cover and within the pertinent procedural steps. Flight hardware must be treated with respect, each operation should be executed with care as though it was the first time it was being performed. Periodic training is needed to keep the I&amp;T personnel mentally alert for repetitive operations on long duration contracts. The I&amp;T team should not feel hampered or overly constrained, but they should always be cognizant of the value of the flight hardware and the need to work with it cautiously. Procedure execution
    discipline must beenforced so that the proper I&amp;T crew needed for that operation is assembled for each operation, procedures are followed and each step independently witnessed. Product assurance personnel must function effectively as independent verifiers. No assumptions should be made about the state of the spacecraft and ground support equipment (within reason, ground support equipment does not need to be torn down and built up after a shift change). Every team member should feel empowered to voice concerns and not have them ignored. There must be open communication among the team members.   
      

    6. Procedure execution discipline is essential  
      
    Lessons Learned:  
      
    Procedure execution discipline must be sustained by the I&amp;T team. The NOAA-N Prime accident occurred in part because the procedures were not followed. An incomplete I&amp;T crew was assembled to run the operation. System safety was not notified to send a representative as required by the procedure. The government quality representative was called when the operation started, but he told the Responsible Test Engineer to start without him and he would get there later. He should have been present in the clean room at the start of the hazardous spacecraft tilt operation, but he did not arrive until after the accident occurred. The Responsible Test Engineer started the operation with these people absent, in violation of procedure requirements. Quality representatives affixed their stamps to attest that they witnessed certain procedure steps before the accident, when in fact they had not. Quality assurance failed to function as an independent authority carefully double checking all work. One member of the I&amp;T team actually questioned the configuration of the turn over cart, but the RTE did not go to look at it, instead he told the technician he was wrong. These lapses of procedure execution discipline and the failure to acknowledge the opinion of a member of the I&amp;T crew resulted in the terrible NOAA-N Prime accident.   
      
    Spacecraft I&amp;T is difficult work with little margin for error, often involving flight hardware worth hundreds of millions of dollars. I&amp;T should be performed according to established policies and configuration controlled procedures. The workers and their management must be sincere about following these rules. Procedures should not be run without the full I&amp;T team present required for the operation. A pre operations meeting should be held so that all personnel understand the operation to be performed. Operation sign-off must occur with personal cognizance of the participants or independent validators. Only those procedure steps actually performed and/or witnessed should be stamped off. Procedure instructions must be clearly communicated and understood by all personnel involved in the operation. I&amp;T test procedures should be clearly written. Vague words like &ldquo;assure&rdquo; and &ldquo;verify&rdquo; should not be used; they should be replaced with specific actions
    having measurable results where possible. I&amp;T team members should be able to ask questions at any time and every I&amp;T team member should know that he is authorized to stop an operation if he feels there is a problem. Government presence required by a procedure can only be waived by approval from the Project Office&raquo;s System Assurance Manager. Waiving mandatory government I&amp;T presence should be rarely, if ever, permitted.  
      
    The role of the government must be clear. Which government I&amp;T responsibilities are delegated by NASA to DCMA should be known to everyone in the contractor&raquo;s and government&raquo;s organizations. NASA responsibilities on the I&amp;T floor should be defined so that the contractor understands each type of oversight. The contractor must track, examine, categorize and trend the nature and closure of the contractor identified non-conformance reports or the DCMA generated Corrective Action Requests. The government must also monitor and track the closure of actions, deficiencies, and recommendations resulting from outside audits and reviews. All results should be shared with the contractor. Corrective measures to improve I&amp;T should be jointly developed with the contractor and jointly monitored for effectiveness.  
      
    There must be consequences if procedure execution discipline is not followed. I&amp;T employees need to be told by their supervisors what is expected of them. Poor performers should not have access to high value flight hardware. The supervisors must lead by example and follow all the rules themselves.  
      

    7. Develop clear documentation, minimize use of redlines  
      
    Lessons Learned:  
      
    The operation being run on the day of the NOAA-N Prime mishap was a unique, one-time activity. It consisted of removing an instrument, installing a shim, and reinstalling the instrument. Individual segments of the operation, such as the instrument installation, were documented in released and previously run I&amp;T test procedures. But, instead of developing a new procedure for the shimming operation, portions of existing procedures were cobbled together with red-lines. This made it difficult to follow the flow as it wove in and out of various procedures In addition, portions of the existing procedures were red-lined. All of this out of sequence activity may have confused the I&amp;T crew and contributed to the mishap.   
      
    Red-lines are useful tools that enable the continuation of an I&amp;T operation when minor unexpected problem arise. But, the use of red-lines must be minimized and carefully controlled. Red-lines must be clearly understood and appropriate to the operation before they are executed. If a procedure is red-lined during an I&amp;T operation because of an unforeseen circumstance, there must be concurrence by the independent product assurance personnel and government quality witnesses. If any member of the I&amp;T team questions the red-line, then the operation should be stopped and the issue resolved with the cognizant engineering personnel.  
      
    Red-lines must be documented as either one-time or permanent for future procedure use. It is up to the contractor&raquo;s product assurance organization and government oversight to ensure that red-lines are not used on the floor repeatedly. If a red-line is determined to be a permanent change, then the procedure should be formally updated through the established configuration control review and approval process.  
      
    The contractor and the government should audit the use of red-lines to assure that they are used appropriately. If excessive use of red-lines are found, corrective measures should be taken by the contractor.   
      

    8. Perform advanced I&amp;T planning  
      
    Lessons Learned:  
      
    Sufficient time must be allocated to prepare for each I&amp;T operation according to approved configuration management requirements. The NOAA-N Prime instrument shimming operation was inserted into the I&amp;T schedule on a Thursday with the intent to execute it two days later on Saturday. There was a rush to develop the authorizing paperwork. The preparation of the I&amp;T procedure for an operation that had never been performed in this sequence was hurried. It was difficult to assemble an I&amp;T team on short notice, most technicians who were approached on Friday about working on Saturday declined.   
      
    No I&amp;T operation has such urgency that planning can be bypassed. All new I&amp;T operations must be carefully planned and communicated to all participants. It should not be a race against time to prepare the paperwork and search out an I&amp;T team. The focus of a new I&amp;T operation should be on accurately preparing it. System safety considerations must be made. All configuration management steps must be followed to develop new procedures. A full review should be made of the procedure by all appropriate groups (system engineering, I&amp;T, quality, safety, government, etc.) prior to the release of a new procedure.   
      
    There are times when a complete procedure cannot be developed in advance, such as while troubleshooting an intermittent problem where the follow on steps vary based on the test results. Even in these cases, there should be time to plan the basic approach and assemble the correct I&amp;T team.  
      
    The government should be aware of the amount of time it takes to prepare I&amp;T documentation and should not allow the contractor to work with the flight hardware without the required paperwork. The contractor&raquo;s product assurance organization should not allow an operation to proceed if it has not fully matured. The NASA in-plant representatives or DCMA should stop any operation that does not appear to be properly planned.  
      

    9. Provide configuration control of ground support equipment that interfaces to flight hardware  
      
    Lessons Learned:  
      
    Two different spacecraft programs were housed in the same high bay, clean room complex when the NOAA-N Prime accident occurred. Each had multiple satellites in production. The programs used similar mechanical ground equipment including two functionally identical satellite turn over carts. There were two turn over carts that could be used by either program when configured correctly. This shared equipment was not maintained under configuration control. The prevailing philosophy at the time of the mishap was that the configuration of the mechanical ground equipment should be checked prior to use in an I&amp;T operation.  
      
    The accident occurred because the procedure to assure that the turn over cart was in the proper configuration was not followed. The root cause of the accident was the bolts that attached the adapter plate to the turn over cart were missing, so the satellite fell off the cart as it was being tilted from vertical to horizontal. Had the turn over cart been under configuration control, the bolts should not have been removed without the proper authority and coordination with the I&amp;T team that was using the turn over cart.  
      
    All ground equipment, mechanical and electrical, that interfaces to flight hardware should be under configuration control. Electrical ground equipment, especially software systems, must be configured items maintained in a known, reproducible state. Data base values, limits, coefficients, flight software load images, ground software, calibration status, etc. must all be controlled so that spacecraft test results can be evaluated and compared from test to test. Similarly, mechanical ground equipment must be controlled in a known state. Proof testing data, drawings and schematics, failure modes effects analysis, operational hazard analysis, etc. must be available so that the equipment can be used with confidence.

"464",1573,"Winterlin, Ronald ","Sub-project Management Authority"," Key subordinate project management positions must be truly accountable to the Project Manager.  Sub-project managers must be empowered to manage and make decisions pertaining to their element of the project.  Roles, responsibilities and authority of SP managers should be agreed to by line and project management and formally documented up front.  The sub-project managers should be recognized as having the appropriate management authority necessary to make key decisions in both the direction of the work and the funding required to accomplish it.  The Advanced Air Transportation Technologies (AATT) Project perspective is that ideally such key positions as sub-project managers should report directly to the project manager.  Any agreements and arrangements for matrix organizational support must be carefully thought out, documented and communicated to all involved organizations including management (all levels) and those responsible to do the work.  Special attention should be given to assure this support is indeed provided through the life of the project and that continuity is maintained when personnel inevitably turnover.  AATT experienced a significant amount of key position turnovers and in some instances new managers reinvented the wheel which has an effect on all support staff impacting overall effectiveness and efficiency.

Hence, package qualification verification (PQV) may be particularly suited to predicting RTD failure- arguably more suited than a collective mechanical design guideline for packaging (e.g., 155 deg C range for 200 cycles). The need for PQV may be overlooked in plans and contracts because hardware featuring RTDs may be mistakenly considered to be purely mechanical assemblies. Also, a problem with qualifying a single standard mounting configuration is the lack of analytical insight into what changes may invalidate the flight qualification.

In implementing the custom requirement set and associated verification testing for these TCs notable anomalies/problems were encountered in two areas. The primary problem was the discovery of contamination (mostly Carbon deposits) on the inner surfaces of the TC that led to acceptance test failures. A secondary problem was caused by attempting to maximize the TC wire size yet limiting the overall TC sheath diameter leading to assembly problems of each TC. "," Mechanical means of cleaning/scrubbing inside surfaces removes most particulate contamination. Vacuum baking of the individual piece parts has limited effectiveness in removing contaminants. Use of the Alcohol-based solvents for cleaning leads to deposits on the surfaces of the piece parts and also can be absorbed into the surfaces (esp. HaO insulator). The potential of contaminant deposit on the inside of the TC during acceptance testing, including operating temperature calibration, requires careful selection of cleaning agents as well as the cleaning of all parts prior to assembly and keeping all parts clean throughout the assembly and testing process. Use of alcohol-based cleaners should be avoided as they have a tendency to be absorbed into the materials and then during high temperature operations will be deposited as Carbon on all inside surfaces of the TC thus causing TC failure during ATP. Use of mild soap and water (deionized) is the preferable final cleaning agent.
    Carefully evaluate the tolerances, clearances and characteristics of the parts required for assembly and procure extra hardware piece parts to facilitate assemble.

"478",1555,"Mendoza, Donald ","External Relations, Customers, Tech Transfer"," Most all projects in today&raquo;s environment invariably require the cooperation and support of multiple organizations both in development and acceptance of project deliverables (including multiple government agencies, the project&raquo;s customers, educational institutions and potential industry stakeholders and users). With resources scarce at all levels and close oversight and scrutiny (both internally and externally), the importance of the inevitable matrix organizations established to carry out programs and projects from formulation through implementation cannot be overemphasized.  
      
    The AATT Project made a significant effort in communicating and developing agreements with key partners such as the FAA, as a primary receiver/user of the Project&raquo;s products. A multitude of Memorandum of Understanding/Agreements, etc, were established and utilized during the life of this project. Clearly, the partnership with the FAA proved to be the Project&raquo;s greatest challenge.  
      
    With continuous management and organizational changes at all levels, policy and procedure changes, etc., AATT experienced problems, as grouped and summarized below:  
      
    A. Interacting with, and learning to work with an entirely different federal agency such as the FAA: It took much time and resources to experience and understand key cultural and organizational differences involving everything from policy, procedures, politics, and communication processes in both technical and administrative/management domains. Comments at all levels across the AATT Project demonstrate that this was one of the most significant ongoing challenges. The FAA failed for a number of reasons to provide consistent single points of contact (POC) for any appreciable length of time. One manager reports that &ldquo;the average life&rdquo; of an FAA POC has been less than 2 years&rdquo;. Also, unexpected union issues and concerns ensued with the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) and the Professional Airways Systems Specialists (PASS), which were increased since AATT had a presence at more than one FAA facility. To further complicate things, continual shifts
    and/orreorganizations within the FAA resulted in AATT technology being moved from organization to organization constantly requiring NASA managers and researchers to educate and establish relationships with new FAA personnel.  
      
    B. Resource Support: As the AATT Project matured, FAA commitments to provide joint support funding, personnel and/or facilities declined for a number of reasons. AATT learned the high risk this really is from the start and how it can lead to de-scoping, schedule delays or tradeoffs not originally foreseen.  
      
    C. Technical Transfer of Project Products: AATT invested much time and energy in working with a number of FAA POCs at various levels to establish an agreed upon process and understanding of technologies to be passed on for further development and implementation into the National Airspace System (NAS). The FAA has stated that they are often unprepared for the research NASA develops that they are then expected to further develop and implement into the operational environment. The AATT tailored TRL (Technology Readiness Level) process has been used for these purposes. An ongoing problem AATT has experienced is the FAA&raquo;s desire and need to know how a newly developed NASA technology being handed over, will fit into the evolving NAS.  
      
    D. External Agreements and Management Support: As indicated above, the AATT Project was subjected to much instability and organizational dynamics in its relationship to the FAA. Formal agreements that were made and in place between the FAA and the AATT Project regarding technologies to be prototyped, demonstrated, and transferred in support of stakeholder requirements were ignored. In light of this, it is crucial to gain long-term top-level management support from any and all key participating organizations including necessary resource commitments.  
      
     "," For all of the above listed examples, the importance of establishing strong up-front relationships and communications between all levels of management authority down to working collaborations cannot be overemphasized. This is especially important when two large federal agencies are involved that must work successfully together to research and develop complex technical concepts and tools that must be passed from one to the other for implementation into the operational systems of the real world.

"479",1551,"mendoza, Donald ","In-House vs. Out-of-House Staffing Mix"," The original Advanced Air Transportation Technologies (AATT) acquisition strategy identified a rough 70/30 % funding split between procurement and in-house dollars spent. Research and technical support organizations were allowed to make specific decisions in these matters as long as overall project and procurement guidelines and requirements were generally being met.  
      
    A number of inputs to the AATT request for &ldquo;lessons learned&rdquo; emphasized the importance of maintaining a strong core competency in air traffic management research within the civil service staff. Maintaining a core competency is considered critical when adjusting to funding shortfalls, as well as maintaining appropriate technical focus and research product development.

The discipline of preparing and peer reviewing formal engineering reports leads to a high degree of accuracy and technical rigor. "," It has been two years since the cracks were originally discovered in the flowliners at the gimbal joint of the LH2 feedlines. In that time, numerous important observations, analyses, and tests have been accomplished. The ITA Team found extensive documentation archived on a web site (SSPWEB) maintained by the Program Office. However, the preponderance of documentation is in the form of briefing charts prepared for oral presentations. Also, the team found extensive technical information available from individual engineers working on the problem resolution team. Unfortunately, much of this information was not properly documented in formal engineering reports. Also, there is no evidence that critical findings were formally peer reviewed. While numerous examples of incomplete documentation could be sited, two specific examples are discussed below to illustrate the potential implications of the lack of technical rigor that might occur when formal documentation is not required and the
    results are not independently verified through peer review.  
      
    The location, orientation, and length of cracks originally found in the fleet in 2002 could not be determined from the original documentation given to the ITA Team. In fact, the numerous problem summary briefings given by engineers and senior team leaders, dating from August 2002 to January 2004, contained conflicting data on both the number of cracks found in each orbiter and the length of these cracks. To resolve these discrepancies, an extensive effort was required to re-analyze the original inspection data obtained in 2002. During this effort to establish accurate crack information, it was discovered that several cracks were kinked rather than extending in a self-similar crack growth direction as was implied by the sketches and analyses reported in the briefing charts. This is a significant finding because kinked cracks like those found in the orbiters, typically exhibit bifurcation behavior and change crack growth direction due to complexities in the global stress field. This
    is critical information in determining the root causes of the cracks observed in the fleet. In fact, incorrect conclusions regarding the problem resolution could have resulted from this omission of critical evidence.  
      
     As part of the investigation, two engine hot fire test series were conducted at Stennis Space Center. The purpose of these tests was to better understand the feedline flow physics and the associated forcing functions, which define the spectrum loadings on the flowliner. The first test series used a BTA with a fixed joint and without a flexible bellow. The second test series used a GTA with a gimbaled joint and flexible bellow. Not only did NASA invest considerable resources to conduct these tests, the interpretation of the test results has led to an escalation in concern over the structural integrity of the flowliners and an additional expenditure of tens of millions of dollars in an attempt to develop a new flight rationale. Yet, there is no formal test report that documents the calibration of instrumentation, test procedures, sequence of test events, test data acquisition, and post-test data reduction. Furthermore, there is no formal documentation of the engineering details
    regarding how the data was used to develop a loading spectrum and the associated prediction of the residual fatigue lives of the flowliners.

"490",1487,"Harris, Charles ","Need for Ground Test Facilities Which Simulate the Flight Environment"," One of the most difficult obstacles to overcome in resolving the problem of the cracks found in the flowliners at the gimbal joint of the LH2 feedlines of the Orbiter fleet has been the disparity of the propellant feed systems between the ground-based test facility and the flight vehicle. Ground testing should be conducted in as close to flight configuration as possible. Where differences between ground and flight configurations or environments are necessary, every effort to correlate the ground test data to actual flight situations must be made.
 "," 
One of the most difficult obstacles to overcome in the flowliner investigation has been the disparity of the propellant feed systems between the ground-based test facility and the flight vehicle. NASA does not have a Flight-Configured Main Propulsion System (MPS) Ground Test Facility that accurately simulates the flight environment. Differences between the ground-based test facility and the flight vehicle can singularly and collectively degrade the fidelity of ground-based hot fire tests in characterizing the flight environment. Examples encountered during the course of this investigation include the following:
  

  Differences in the feedline weld bead in feedline between flowliners and SSME interface;  
  Differences in thermal insulation (i.e., vacuum jacket vs. BX-250 SOFI) on the feedlines;  
  Differences in feedline layout (i.e., line lengths, bends, flex joints, valves, flow meters); and  
  Differences in sensors and sensor locations.  
</ul>

The inability to accurately replicate the flight conditions of the MPS in a ground test has been a persistent difficulty in determining the fundamental root cause of the flowliner issue. Significant resources and schedule time have been expended to overcome the need for a test facility that replicates the collective environment (e.g., flow, structural, dynamic, thermal, etc.) of the actual flight vehicle. A facility dedicated to subjecting the engine and supporting feed system to a high-fidelity flight environment could be used for acceptance tests, green run tests, and fleet leader extension tests.The MPTA was useful in certifying the MPS for the shuttle, but was retired early in the program. It would not be necessary to configure the system to accommodate all the engines used in the MPS, but to replicate the fluid environment that one engine would be exposed to, with the flexibility of expanding the resolution of the system environment to include as many engines as needed. With regard to the MPS environment of subsequent vehicle programs, the instrumentation suite incorporated into the ground facility could be integrated into the propellant system without significant affect to the characterization of the system environment.

"515",1409,"Rhodeside, Glenn ","Earned Value Management/""RESULTS OF A NASA KENNEDY SPACE CENTER EARNED VALUE MANAGEMENT PILOT PROJECT""/Project Management"," Earned value management (EVM) is a technique used throughout the aerospace industry. An EVM system requires the establishment of a controlled Performance Measurement Baseline (PMB) against which cost, schedule, and technical performance can be integrated and assessed. However, it has only been relatively recently that the rigorous methodologies of EVM have been applied to small projects and/or to in-house Government activities. &ldquo;Small&rdquo; projects may be defined as those with a total dollar value of less than $5M, although this is subjective and must be put in the greater context of an individual project and its organizational environment.  
      
    A set of NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) projects with a dollar range from approximately a few hundred thousand to a few million dollars implemented earned value management as part of a pilot initiative. At least a portion of the work was in-house Government activity. The objectives were to uncover the strengths and weaknesses of EVM for projects of that type and size and to determine what obstacles would stand in the way of EVM implementation. The pilot would identify solutions to these obstacles, if possible. The value of the KSC pilot was to collect data in a structured way rather than just relying on defining issues anecdotally.  
      
    While there has been much verbal discussion on the subject, a literature search produced little dealing explicitly with what size of projects to apply EVM. Government policy and related documents have traditionally dictated total contract value dollar thresholds for the application of EVM and state that it is optional below those thresholds. There is often no discussion as to why the thresholds are what they are versus a lower or a higher number.  
      
     "," The pilot program demonstrated the difficulty in introducing a new method in an environment that is very dynamic. There are many lessons learned in order to help future endeavors.  
      
    Training:  
      
    Although training was given to all project teams, perhaps the time needed and number of examples presented were not sufficient to explain all facets of the subject matter. Perhaps the time should be lengthened to at least two days from half a day, thus allowing more time for explanation of the concepts and for the students to work sample problems, etc. The curriculum used needs to be clear and organized in a way that is attractive to project managers and shows them the benefits to their work.  
      
    Data Acquisition:  
      
    This probably proved to be one of the biggest obstacles to overcome. Since the NASA financial system was and is undergoing a major change, a lot of data were very difficult to obtain in a format that would support EVM. Project managers spent a lot of time looking for data, collecting data, and trying to reconcile data. There was much manual as opposed to automated effort.  
      
    This portion of the pilot was totally underestimated in terms of difficulty, time spent, and level of frustration, which probably did not aid in project manager acceptance of the EVM process. On the bright side, it clearly identified opportunities for improvement in how data is collected so that it can not only support financial requirements but also project management requirements and above all support the project manager so that he/she can have a good tool to manage the project.  
      
    The bottom line on data is to make sure the financial system supports the kind of data that is needed to fully implement EVM without incurring a high cost in time, effort, or budget to the project.  
      
    Tools:  
      
     Another significant finding was the lack of available off-the-shelf software tools to facilitate conversion of data into an EVM format, although some software does exist. However, they seem more suited for large complex projects. At least in our pilot, project managers expressed the need for a &ldquo;magic bullet&rdquo; software solution that would not tax the project manager. Our experience showed that the level of frustration with the implementation was related to the amount of manual data input that was necessary or required. For this pilot, we resisted the creation of &ldquo;in-house&rdquo; software to automate the process other than for minor job aids. We did not successfully recreate a large-scale enterprise solution.  
      
    Environment:  
      
     As stated previously, the NASA environment at the time of the pilot was ever changing; not only was the financial system being overhauled, but also the Agency was moving to &ldquo;full cost accounting&rdquo; as well as other significant changes in the way project management was executed. In retrospect, maybe the pilot was asking too much too fast from the project management population. They had to remain focused on delivering the products while working under an ever changing system. Even though the task of the pilot proved to be daunting, in true NASA tradition the project teams gave it their best shot to support the pilot program and provide invaluable data as to the merits of the pilot.

SNOE was a small scientific satellite that measured the effects of energy from the sun and from the magnetosphere on the density of nitric oxide in the Earth's upper atmosphere. The SNOE was launched on February 27, 1998 and reentered on December 13, 2003 at 09:34 GMT.  
      
     This document summarizes the lessons learned for the reentry of the SNOE. Even though SNOE was a small spacecraft that had little possibility of impacting the earth, it was an excellent opportunity for SSMO to work through our perceived reentry process. These lessons learned will help to clarify the activities during the reentry of any other NASA mission. Also, recommendations for changes to the NASA Policy Directive (NPD 8710.3A), NASA Policy for Limiting Orbital Debris Generation, will also be suggested.  
      
    Predicting reentry dates is an important task for NASA to maintain public safety. Despite any minimal probability for debris impacting, the mission specific program/project must be aware of all reentry related information including launch vehicles and upper stages.  
    Summary of Lessons Learned:  
      
     "," All of the lessons learned form the SNOE reentry are summarized below and are discussed in detail in the following section.  
     

      
        &rdquo;Maintenance&rdquo; of reentry information is not defined in the current version of NPD 8710.3A. Updates to the reentry information are done more on a &ldquo;calendar&rdquo; basis instead of a &ldquo;relative reentry&rdquo; basis.  

        The &ldquo;coordination&rdquo; of reentry information within the agency and &ldquo;notification to appropriate personnel&rdquo; is ambiguous within the NPD.  

        The ""mission specific program/project"" is responsible for implementing the orbital debris mitigation measures and guidelines. To be able to do this effectively the program needs to understand the orbit and reentry characteristics for each mission, and the daily operations and orbit determination activities are an essential input to the reentry predictions. The orbit determination activities are also necessary to plan the daily operational passes. Any &ldquo;program specific"" predictions must be coordinated with Code Q (OSMA).  

        CMOC routinely provides standard orbit data (TLE, etc) to GSFC OIG web site and to JSC. All NASA related reentry information is normally distributed to JSC. Any request for &ldquo;special data&rdquo; needs to be coordinated with CMOC and JSC so as not to cause confusion with the standard data processing.

"535",1414,"Mendoza, Donald ","Acquisition Philosophy and Mechanism"," A &ldquo;Fly-off&rdquo; type of procurement using a relatively small Source Evaluation Board (SEB) can minimize the time to assess, award, and implement a contract. However, in order to minimize the Government's risk under this process, the SEB must leverage enough expertise (in &ldquo;ex-official&rdquo; status, if necessary, to fill any knowledge gaps the small SEB might have) to ensure all the Contractor's business practices are adequate and reflect a system that provides sufficient insight/oversight to build the required &ldquo;hands-off&rdquo; Government/Contractor relationship after contract award. "," In order to use a &ldquo;fly-off&rdquo; type of procurement to minimize the time to assess, award, and implement a contract while ensuring the Government's risk is minimized, the following issues should be considered.  
     

      
        While it can improve efficiency, a small selection team (SEB) may not be adequately effective in assessing all technical and programmatic areas.  

        Any technical or programmatic areas not sufficiently addressed during procurement may increase the Government's risk during contract implementation. This is especially true in instances where an originally selected system design is found to be inadequate and in need of a re-design (in the case of the Project in question, new analytical tools and techniques available after Contract award helped to identify new risks and needed design improvements). While the Government is responsible to identify inadequacies at any and all times during the project life cycle, it must make every effort to completely remove itself from the Contractor's design process. Any participation by the Government in the design undermines the philosophy of placing the risk (via ownership of design) on the Contractor and exposes the Government to a higher level of risk. The Government must be cognizant of this immigration of risk when it elects to participate in a design process, and must balance the risk
      of effectively acquiring ownership of the design against other risks inherent in the situation or migrating to it.  

        Since the procurement's goal is to minimize the time from start to finish, part of it its philosophy is to instill efficiency into the Contractor-Government roles and relationships. Thus, it becomes paramount during the selection process to ensure that the Contractor's processes, procedures, and tools are adequate (as based on some established criteria such as ISO 9001 and/or CMMI) to allow the Government to take a &ldquo;hands-off&rdquo; approach during implementation. Also, any criteria to be used to verify/validate and or assess the Contractor's work after contract award must be consistent and compatible with the performance criteria levied on the Contractor.  
      
    The Project successfully addressed these issues with the addition of extra resources (technical experts, analysis tools, schedule, and funding) and the willingness to accept additional development risk via more hands-on involvement in order to reduce the overall risk. In addition, the Project planned its recovery efforts such that they where focused on the product and did not overburden its delivery with force fit or unnecessary processes, i.e. only those processes critical to the products success were developed and employed rather than imposing a conventional process certification/assessment approach. Thus, the Project's approach to compliment the SEB's fly-off approach with real-time adjustments (even against conventional wisdom and/or original intent) based on the increased knowledge that contract implementation brings ensured that the best interests of the Agency where secured.

"550",1385,"Bonine, Lisa ","Comet Nucleus Tour (CONTOUR) Mishap Investigation"," The Comet Nucleus Tour, CONTOUR, was designed and built by Johns Hopkins University with specialized support from NASA as a part of NASA's Discovery series of solar system exploration satellites. Launched on July 3, 2002, it was intended to encounter at least two comets to perform a variety of analyses on comet material. However, sometime after the solid rocket motor (SRM) intended to move the satellite out of eccentric earth orbit was fired, the satellite was lost. Mission design did not allow for observation or telemetry coverage during SRM burn, so the mishap investigation board was unable to determine with certainty the cause of the failure. However, a major finding of the investigation was that telemetry or visual coverage of the satellite during SRM burn was, in fact, possible and may help prevent similar mishaps in the future. "," I. A major lesson learned was that all spacecraft should retain telemetry or visual contact during critical phases of the mission.  
      
    II. The team felt the mishap may have been driven by certain practices that the team described as more typical of small projects managed by contractor Principal Investigators. These practices include:  
    II-1. Reliance of CONTOUR project on analysis by similarity  
    Although flight history of a selected component is one aspect of acceptance by similarity, it is important to consider whether the application is consistent and within the bounds of previous qualification.  
     II-2. Inadequate systems engineering process and specification of requirements  
    The board cited the fact that few requirements were imposed by NASA regarding the way contractors document or performed work on CONTOUR, creating opportunities for contractors to adopt nonstandard engineering practices.  
     II-3. Inadequate review functions  
    The board felt that inadequate oversight was especially dangerous in combination with nonstandard engineering practices.  
      
     Other observations noted by the team were the lack of telemetry/observation of spacecraft during a critical mission event, a tendency to rely on subcontractors without appropriate insight/oversight, the use of analytic models that were not specific to CONTOUR, a limited understanding of SRM plume heating environments in space, the lack of an orbital debris conjunction plan, and a limited understanding of SRM operating conditions. These are covered in detail in the ""CONTOUR Mishap Investigation Board Report.&rdquo;

These events and lessons are listed below. "," a. System Requirements Document (SRD)  
    In addition to Ka-band requirements, the SRD also included S band transmit and receive requirements for the system since the antenna was dual band. However, S band requirements should have been stated at a higher level. Much effort went into justifying and verifying S band equipment performance specs. Nearly 75% of the SRD requirements were related to S band. The SRD should have focused less on the S band requirements, since the intent of the system was primarily to demonstrate the Ka performance. The S band subsystems utilized standard, proven equipment that were already in use in the GN.  
      
    b. High Data Rate Receiver  
     For bit error rate (BER) testing, it is recommended to use receivers that have been optimized for the data rates under test. Although the unit used during demonstration testing was very flexible and useful for general lab support, the receiver performance in terms of implementation loss at the higher data rates of interest was not adequate to support the objectives of the test. The implementation loss of the test receiver was higher than expected and created difficulties in obtaining useful BER test data. It would also be recommended that a receiver manufacturer take into account the system channel magnitude and phase response to optimally match the receiver filter for best ISI performance.  
      
    c. Boresite Antenna  
     The use of a smaller boresite antenna, or separate antennas for S and Ka band would provide better performance during boresite testing, particularly in high wind situations. For example, a WR-34 horn was used during the latter portion of the demonstration testing, and it provided improved performance compared to the one meter parabolic antenna for this test scenario. It is also recommended to use the same boresite antenna for on-site testing that is used for factory testing. When problems were encountered on-site that did not appear at the factory, the local boresite antenna was blamed for the problems. Using the same boresite antenna would eliminate any finger pointing in a similar situation.  
      
    d. Channel Distortions  
    It is recommended that system requirements be levied on one vender that is responsible for the entire ground terminal design, integration, and test. For example, the magnitude and phase response for the entire channel should be specified from RF input to IF output, and the vendor should perform an allocation of theses end-to-end system requirements to individual components. Distortion measurements through the whole system should be verified at the factory prior to delivery. Also it is recommended that the receiver be mounted close to antenna, and transfer the IF signal in digital format via fiber optic cable rather than at the intermediate frequency. Cable runs should be minimized, and the use very low loss cable is recommended.  
      
    e. Radome  
    The vendor should demonstrate water tightness of radome prior to delivery and installation on-site.  
      
    f. Antenna axis configuration  
    The X-Y axis configuration is the recommended approach for a ground terminal that is required to track low-earth orbiting spacecraft. This configuration precludes the use of a third tilt axis to handle high elevation passes. The X-Y axis system is less complex, improving maintenance and reliability.  
      
    g. Ka Feed components  
    Nearly all problems encountered with the feed were the result of low quality cables and adapters. Recommend in the future that reliability be considered more than cost for the feed subsystem components.

        System Requirements Document (SRD) Development  

      <li style=""list-style: none"">  
        
      
    The SRD development task unnecessarily grew in scope and began to encompass future follow-on work. In addition to Ka-band IF requirements, several versions of the SRD included performance issues related to CCSDS data routing. Considerable time and effort was expended on reviewing documentation that was not pertinent to the task at hand. The SRD should have focused on the function and performance requirements of the Ka-band IF implementation task   

    <ol start=""2"">
        Analysis  
      
    The WSC KaTP team did not originally allocate any labor costs or schedule impacts associated with performing analysis to the waveguide and phase nonlinearity issues. Delays to the KaTP project were incurred while a contractor team was called on to perform additional &ldquo;impact to system performance&rdquo; analysis. An example of this was experienced during the decision on total amounts of phase nonlinearity allowable for the KaTP infrastructure during the Waveguide Equalizer procurement. On a project with the scope, complexity and challenges of the KaTP, the team must consider budgeting additional hours for these unforeseen problems.  

    <ol start=""3"">
        Vendor Delivery  
      
    While the KaTP implementation schedule was aggressive, one could not account for the large delays encountered from the vendors. The contractor team spent considerable time and energy working with the vendor and pushing for delivery. In future large procurements, the contractor team should account for some vendor delays when forecasting schedule and there should be some way of enforcing vendors to deliver hardware on time (either through incentives or penalties incorporated into the contract). The procurement office should have been involved earlier and they may have worked the delivery issues since they control the payments and have more clout with the vendor. Additional time in schedule should be allocated to do more work on vendor surveys and &ldquo;requests for information&rdquo; from prospective vendors. This may have given the KaTP team a better feel for aggressive specifications and alternative architectures. In some cases the team received one vendor quote, which implies
    the specifications may have been too restrictive.  

    <ol start=""4"">
        Equipment Procurement  
      
    The KaTP contractor team has learned to project more time into a schedule to account for RFP technical evaluations, initiating procurements through the CLF, and getting vendors under contract. For large acquisitions, this process can take four to eight weeks.  

    <ol start=""5"">
        Project Budget  
      
    The size and complexity of the KaTP presented several unique challenges. From the onset, NASA project management stated the project had limited funds, however, they wanted to accomplish all of the goals of the project. The KaTP team attempted to achieve a system that met all the requirements with a minimal amount of risk to the project budget and schedule. This approach drove the team to implement an architecture similar to the legacy design and in the future the team should evaluate the critical parameters that impact system performance and choose an architecture that would minimize this risk.   

    <ol start=""6"">
        Waveguide Equalizer Equipment Definition  
      
    The KaTP team focused on an IF frequency Waveguide Equalizer too quickly without weighing other options. This decision was based somewhat on the legacy equipment design using an IF-based equalizer. The team should have explored other possibilities concurrently but the time and effort was not allocated into the schedule.   

    <ol start=""7"">
        225 MHz Downconverter Modifications  
      
    The legacy 225 MHz downconverters were built as custom units and the implementation varied from chassis to chassis. This problem could not have been foreseen, a realistic schedule should allot additional time to handle unforeseen problems.  

    <ol start=""8"">
        Interference with TDRSS Telemetry Signal  
      
    The KaTP team should have contacted the NASA spacecraft engineering group charged with the development of the TDRS- HIJ series spacecraft to determine the rationale for their frequency plan. The spacecraft manufacturer chose to design a specific frequency plan for the TDRS-HIJ series satellites that was not compatible with the SNIP frequency plan. The KaTP team should have researched this issue more thoroughly during the design and implementation of the ground infrastructure.  

    <ol start=""9"">
        SN Demonstration  
      
    The KaTP was hindered during the SN Demonstration tests by test equipment that exhibited higher than expected implementation losses. A considerable amount of time was spent verifying the test equipment, understanding and characterizing the losses inherent in the various test configurations. It is recommended that test receivers should be optimized for the data rate under test. Future testing should incorporate test equipment that meets or exceeds the fidelity one is trying to demonstrate. Suspect test equipment reduces the confidence in the test results and impacts the schedule and budget.

"606",1384,"Parker, Yvonne ","Kennedy Space Center (KSC) Projects and Resources Online (KPRO) Software Development and Implementation"," Kennedy Space Center (KSC) Projects and Resources Online (KPRO) is a KSC software development project to implement a project management information system that meets the unique requirements of NASA. The KPRO team has encountered both good and bad experiences throughout the software development life cycle. These experiences include: Working in direct consultation with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) vendors; having a signed agreement when interfacing with external databases; training the target workforce thoroughly for using the developed software; having a management agreement for resources committed to the project; and expending effort to build a cohesive team with proper skills and expertise. These are documented as lessons learned, along with recommendations, and presented as reference for future software development project teams. ","  
        Advantages to KPRO were the direct consultation with Microsoft, participation on the P10 (Microsoft Project 2002) Beta Team, and being a member of the Microsoft Joint Development Program. This gave KSC the ability to counter consult with Microsoft and deliver the initial product earlier than the normal life cycle.  

      <li style=""list-style: none"">  
        

        A signed agreement should be in place before proceeding with implementation of an interface with another database management system. KPRO had a verbal agreement with a NASA counterpart to support an interface between KPRO and a contractor database to provide actual expense data. The KPRO developer proceeded with coding as agreed to verbally. When the verbal agreement was presented in a written format in the form of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), the decision was made not to provide the verbally agreed-upon interface. Another method was selected. The developer was required to get an account on the contractor reporting system and develop a report rather than receiving the data electronically per a verbal agreement. It is suspected that the reason for the reversal was that upper management was not informed early-on of the terms of the verbal agreement. The new direction resulted in approximately 4 weeks lost time in implementing a requirement to obtain actual expense data
      for projects in KPRO.  

        The project management workforce should be thoroughly trained and engaged in implementing Agency project management processes before introducing a new tool that adds capabilities in support of the Agency processes. The lack of rigorous project management practices delayed efficient and broad use of the new tool and initially reduced its effectiveness. After emphasizing the processes and offering intensified training on the use of the capabilities of KPRO, there was a noticeable improvement in the project management environment. Project managers managed their projects more efficiently and increased their productivity.  

        The project manager should obtain a commitment to ensure that a dedicated systems engineer is assigned to the project full time during the requirements phase. A systems engineer was assigned to KPRO and attempted to gather KPRO requirements. The individual was spread too thin and pulled off too often to successfully complete his KPRO assignment. This resulted in about 3 months of development time lost while the developers pitched in and assisted the project manager with the requirements document.  

        Building a team with people who work well together and have the proper expertise can make or break a project. KPRO was very fortunate to have formed a small talented, cohesive team to work on the project. The original development team is still intact after more than 2 years. This has been a major factor in the successful implementation of this project management tool at KSC.

     Integration of NGN's many components was a challenge both in terms of the management of the system-to-system interfaces and in the management of lines of authority and reporting for the various organizations involved. One of the methods used to manage this complexity was to charter a quarterly review panel consisting of &ldquo;stake-holder&rdquo; participants with management authority of the various NGN components.

        Test and prototype COTS products in the lab. The prototyping and test phase of the COTS evaluation allows problems to be identified as the system design to matures. These problems can be mitigated (often with the help and cooperation of the COTS vendor) well before the field-testing phase at which time it may be too costly or impossible to retrofit a solution. The following lessons were learned in the prototyping and test phase of the SAFS/CSAFS development.  
      

    
        Prototype your systems hardware and software in a lab setting as similar to the field environment as possible; simulate how the product will work on various customer platforms; model the field operations; develop in stages with ongoing integration and testing  

        Pass pertinent information on to your customers  

        Accommodate your customers, where possible, by building in alternative options  

        Don't approve all requests for additional options by customers or new projects that come on line.  

        Select the best COTS components for product performance even if they are from multiple vendors.

"617",1714,"Johnson, Leslie ","Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle (UAV), Flight Test Operations, Accident Investigation","A high performance jet-powered UAV crashed on landing.  A subsequent investigation into the root cause(s) found that the ground support crew did not follow all of the steps in a complex checklist and the pilot did not adhere to the flight parameters dictated by the flight test card.  Omission of pre-flight steps resulted in lower than expected engine thrust performance.  This off-nominal thrust condition caused the pilot to attempt to compensate throughout the flight.  This compensation, along with other complicating factors, caused the pilot to mismanage the UAVs energy, resulting in a landing touchdown speed that was well above rated touchdown speeds, resulting in the collapse of the left main landing gear.  The pilot did not have any previous experience with this UAV.  A primary complicating factor was that the pilot did not know and was not briefed on several key UAV performance factors, primary of which was maximum touchdown speed.  Less than adequate communications between the pilot and ground support crew both in preflight and flight was also a complicating factor.  During the crash, the flight crew was exposed to potential injury since they were situated at the runway edge near the UAV touchdown point.
<br/>
<br/>Execution of each step in a checklist should be independently verified, especially the complex checklists used in these operations.  A pilot briefing on critical vehicle performance parameters should be given even if the pilot is expected to know critical flight parameters.  Communications between pilot and ground support crew should be full and open during preflight and flight.  Real time warnings should be provided to the pilot when deviating from the planned flight test parameters.  The flight crew should maintain a safety barrier device between themselves and the vehicle during the landing sequence.","1.  It was clear that the UAV pilot did not know several key flight critical parameters that a pilot should know in order to execute a flight test.  Chief among them were maximum landing speed and maximum flight time at cruise power.
<br/>
<br/>2.  The ground support crew used a complex preflight checklist and skipped a key step that reduced the thrust time rate-of-change to be less than expected by the pilot, resulting in a longer take off roll, and a re-contact with the runway during departure. 
<br/>
<br/>3.  Steps in checklists maybe missed if the checklist is overly complex.  There was no independent or second check that each step in the preflight checklist was executed.
<br/>
<br/>4.  The preflight checklist did not include a briefing of flight critical parameters to the pilot.  The pilot was new to this UAV.
<br/>
<br/>5.  The pilot&apos;s lack of knowledge in a key area of engine thrust trim contributed to the pilot&apos;s perception of off nominal thrust performance during the flight.
<br/>
<br/>6.  The flight crew did not give the pilot real time warnings when flight critical parameters were being exceeded due to the erroneous assumption that the pilot was familiar with the parameters.
<br/>
<br/>7.  UAV pilots cannot be expected to make the best decisions when operating with incomplete or erroneous knowledge of critical flight parameters.

     b. Memorandum of Understanding - The MOU is a tool for gaining agreement at the program level, yet it is too high of a level of agreement for adequate implementation and resource commitment.  
     c. Launch Services Program (LSP)- No OSP Program representation within LSP existed. OSP prime contractors were not limited by data requests/funding; therefore, they requested significant quantities of data. Validation of launch vehicle provider data was required by NASA-LSP prior to delivery of data to OSP but LSP was not adequately staffed to provide throughout and was overburdened by maintaining multiple vehicles (dual compatibility) within the trade space.  
     d. International Space Station - The roles defined for ISS in OSP requirement development, validation and approval were limited (ISS did not sign OSP system requirements) and did not effectively position ISS with formative, substantive influence on the scope or direction of the OSP.  
     e. Launch Services Program-Integration - The most fundamental questions about who would be responsible for what integration work during Design, Development, Test and Evaluation (DDT&amp;E) loomed unresolved. Who would acquire launch services (OSP Prime Contractor? Government furnished services?).

     d. Program Shutdown The OSP program ceased abruptly. Some key players were reassigned early, including both managers and administrative personnel thus further complicating the shutdown task.

"620",1511,"Carr, Lisa ","Orbital Space Plane - Deemphasis of Safety"," The Orbital Space Plane (OSP) Program took many proactive management steps to increase our emphasis on safety. Safety must be NASA's highest priority.  
      
     "," OSP took many proactive management steps to increase our emphasis on safety. However, just below the surface significant flaws existed in our implementation approach resulting in a misunderstanding of the S&amp;MA organizational authority. With the program acceleration, the quality of the safety products was further compromised by abandoning established requirements, processes, tools, and standards of performance. The intent was to catch up on the safety products at SDR and beyond; however, safety is most effective when woven into the fabric of all organizational elements from the start of a program. 

     Additionally: 

     a. S&amp;MA Leadership. Throughout the life of the program, it appeared that OSP S&amp;MA inclusion in management decisions and leadership was ineffective. A misunderstanding in S&amp;MA leadership was created by the presence of a senior S&amp;MA expert (former S&amp;MA employee) on the Program staff, reporting to the Program Manager. His role was to ensure internal Program implementation of and compliance with S&amp;MA requirements and provide a working level interface with the assigned independent S&amp;MA representatives. It now appears that this arrangement somehow gave the impression of diminishing the role of the separately assigned, independent S&amp;MA representatives. 

     b. De-emphasizing S&amp;MA Products. At the Systems Requirements Review (SRR), S&amp;MA products were de-emphasized as a contract deliverable due to acceleration. These same products were not part of the formal review at the SDR for baselining (only comments were allowed); therefore, these S&amp;MA documents did not go through a thorough review and feedback process. The &ldquo;catch-up&rdquo; desired never materialized, and as a result, the normal safety products expected at SDR were deficient. 

     c. S&amp;MA Requirements. Adequate S&amp;MA requirements were not contained in the Level 2 requirements document, and insufficient attention was paid to S&amp;MA data requirements in the contracts. The Program placed so much emphasis on the HRR that we overlooked many, equally important S&amp;MA requirements. 

     d. Level 3 and Level 4 S&amp;MA Requirements Development. Given the inadequate Level 2 S&amp;MA requirements, the Contractors' were unable to develop appropriate Level 3 and 4 S&amp;MA requirements. 

     e. Incomplete Understanding. NASA should not assume the Contractor workforce understands the Government's human space flight expectations. Discipline working groups were needed to provide a forum to assure mutual understanding/interpretation of the S&amp;MA requirements and processes between participating NASA centers, contractors, and related stake holders. Without functioning working groups, the contractors' interpretation and implementation of S&amp;MA requirements were questioned and debated at each program review.

"621",1509,"Carr, Lisa ","Orbital Space Plane - Engineers as Smart Buyers"," The Orbital Space Plane (OSP) Program started up the learning curve early by creating the Acquisition Management Office (AMO) specifically for developing the acquisition strategy, Request For Proposal (RFP) development, and Source Evaluation Board (SEB) support. AMO brought our procurement specialists in at the beginning, trained in advanced procurement methods, benchmarked other successes, and included the contractors in the RFP development. Plan how you buy as carefully as what you want to buy  
      
     "," NASA generally procures major developments years apart rather than months apart. OSP started up the learning curve early by creating the Acquisition Management Office (AMO) specifically for developing the acquisition strategy, Request For Proposal (RFP) development, and Source Evaluation Board (SEB) support. AMO brought our procurement specialists in at the beginning, trained in advanced procurement methods, benchmarked other successes, and included the contractors in the RFP development. 

     Additionally: 

     a. Contract Modification Burdens. It can take considerable time and resources to modify contracts or create extensions in response to program schedule and budget changes. 

     b. Transition from Development to Operations. During development of the Design and Development RFP, there was much discussion concerning when and how to transition to an operational system to ensure appropriate attention to the transition and to ensure flexibility for the government. 

     c. Acquisition Management Office. OSP started up the acquisition learning curve early by creating the Acquisition Management Office (AMO) specifically for developing the acquisition strategy, building the RFP, and organizing and supporting the SEB. It would have been beneficial for other personnel from the OSP Program to have been part of the training so as to understand how to effectively implement the strategy into the transition to the development phase of the program. 

     d. Acquisition Training. A training regimen was instituted very early in a program's life for acquisition, procurement, and Source Evaluation Boards. This effort should begin with research and benchmarking of NASA and DoD best practices. 

     e. Competitive Contractor Feedback. Government/contractor meetings that involved all bidders were of almost no value, because the contractors would not communicate openly. Conversely, the prospective bidders communicated freely in one-on-one government/contractor sessions, and these sessions were very effective. 

     f. Coalition for Acquisition. RFP development was a successful collaboration of engineers, managers, and procurement specialists from across the country. Co-location was the most efficient setting for efficient document development, but, early involvement through distance collaboration enhanced the co-location meetings. Distance collaboration was implemented using a secure, web-based IT tool &ndash; Projectlink. Contractor participation in RFP development resulted in a quality product where quality is defined as a clear articulation of the work to be contracted by the government and a clear understanding of government intent by the bidders. 

     g. Ongoing Work Leading to Proposal. The OSP program and the SEB worked very hard at creating a linear relationship between the architecture work being conducted and the proposal to be delivered in response to the full scale development RFP. This work was incomplete. The contractors had been reporting at least one design iteration behind in their deliverables as late as SDR. The OSP RFP emphasized contractor performance at SDR. This emphasis may have been in error. ","MSFC",2003-07-01,"Aeronautics Research, Exploration Systems, Space Operations, ",FALSE,"",648,34,NA,"https://nen.nasa.gov/web/11/viewall/-/viewall/1509"
"622",1507,"Carr, Lisa ","Orbital Space Plane Budget and Schedule Risk"," Plans, procedures, and policies must be robust enough to withstand the inevitable change in schedules, budgets, and risks. "," A stress crack can grow only if the total energy applied increases or remains constant. Acceleration and budget reductions created stress cracks in the OSP management processes. Lack of defined plans and policies kept the energy level steady or climbing. Communication flow suffered, serial processes became parallel, rigor was diminished, record keeping got lax, and training went to the back burner. 

     Additionally: 

     a. Review Criteria. A specific example of stress cracks during the OSP formulation was the lowering of standards/success criteria for major Program reviews, such as SRR and SDR. Meeting the milestones, baselining the requirements, and conducting the meetings became higher priority than the technical content or adequate assessment of the content. 

     b. Shrinking of the Inner Circle. After each occurrence of increased stress (budget cut, schedule accelerated) the &ldquo;inner circle&rdquo; of the Program Management team seemed to shrink and data flow to the mid-level managers and workers was reduced. 

     c. Focus on Operability. Early in the formulation phase, the OSP Program committed to placing a high emphasis on ensuring &ldquo;operability&rdquo; in the design, to reduce life cycle costs and reduce process-induced failures. When pressure was ramping up, the emphasis on operations infusion into the design fell by the wayside. 

     d. Find the &ldquo;NO&rdquo; Point. Ultimately, during times of &ldquo;belt-tightening&rdquo; things will inevitably be given up... but it would be very advantageous to determine in advance (during the calm periods) the real priorities that can not be allowed to degrade under increased schedule, budget, or political pressure. 

     e. Synchronize Development. Requirement development, analyses, and system design activities were not synchronized. Functional decomposition was not complete before system design started and before Level 3 requirements were base-lined. Also, in the environment of acceleration a Requirements Development Team (RDT), consisting of decision makers from the OSP, ELV and ISS Programs and Headquarters, was formed. This team, although very efficient in making decisions and finalizing requirements, also created some undesired consequences. Limited communication to the outside and limited analysis created an environment where some requirements may have lacked technical feasibility. This led to incomplete requirements and orphan or childless level 2 requirements. 

     f. Program Plan and SEMP. The OSP Program Plan, Systems Engineering Management Plan (SEMP) and related foundational plans (Risk Management, Configuration and Data Management, etc.) were not sufficiently mature when the decision was made to embark on an accelerated program. Parallel development during program execution deadened the sense of urgency to complete them. 

     g. Schedule Planning and Implementation. An OSP schedule guidelines document was not prepared early enough in the program execution. A lack of standardization of inputs from various centers and organizations complicated the Integrated Master Schedule baseline and updates. Additionally, in response to acceleration of the program, two separate schedules of ongoing and planned work were being maintained.

"623",1505,"Carr, Lisa ","Orbital Space Plane - Design Participation & Rules of Engagement - Teaming - Civil Servant & Contractor Teams"," The Orbital Space Plane (OSP) had problems defining the proper technical engagement of civil service personnel with contractor teams. In competitive environments, decide, define and communicate up front how NASA participation is to be conducted with the contractors and staff to support that participation.  
      
     "," Because of our zeal to protect the competitive environment, OSP had problems defining the proper technical engagement of civil service personnel with contractor teams. In the end, we were getting real traction in the right direction with the participation of our experts in the prime contractors' design efforts. But we started staffing and empowering the engineering expert teams later than we should have, and the early constraints on their participation were too severe.  
      
     Additionally:  
     a. Systems Experts. OSP did not form a standing team of human spaceflight system experts until after the contract data deliverables were defined and many of the government and prime contractor system-level trade studies and requirement development analyses were completed. 

     b. Design Participation. During Competition The single largest start-up obstacle we encountered when trying to get the NASA engineering teams engaged on OSP were the limits on their participation. When the NASA teams were formed, these constraints were not clearly defined or recorded. We wanted to create value-adding design participation relationships with the prime contractors, but we did not want to &ldquo;pollute&rdquo; their ideas with our own. We needed to prevent 'cross-contamination' - revealing one contractor's ideas to another - in order to preserve the integrity of the competitive acquisition. We had to consider whether people who were doing activities like performing government task agreements for delivery to one contractor could be a participant with other contractors, or be assigned to manage a subsystem or discipline area, or be allowed to work on RFP development or proposal evaluation. 

     c. Deliverables - required verses needed. The newly established NASA engineering expert teams found themselves inundated at major program milestone reviews with contractual deliverables that were heavy on paper and light on data. 

     d. Release of Government Data. Concerns about releasing pre-decisional, government-developed data and capabilities limited our participation. OSP's initial policy was not to release any government trade or requirement development analysis data, but finally shared some requirements development rationale data. We eventually recorded very useful guidance shortly before the SDR that allowed the teams to share data unless it potentially implied a government-preferred solution, was proprietary, was pre-decisional or was acquisition sensitive. 

     e. Government Task Agreements (GTA). The OSP program and the prime contractors both benefited from GTAs. However, GTAs create considerable consternation for both parties. The program has little insight to GTA performance and even less authority to manage them. Additionally, the contactor can easily blame the Agency at large for issues involving GTAs. Contractors find it difficult to manage GTAs since at a macro level their customer is also their subcontractor. 

     f. Rules of Engagement. OSP Developed and tested a set of Rules of Engagement by which we participated with two competing contractors equally but separately. 

     g. Data Release Policies. OSP Developed, but did not test, policies for government trade study data release to the two competing contractors. 

     h. Current Competencies New human spaceflight systems are not developed frequently - less often via competitive acquisition. No one does enough human-rated spacecraft development to sustain a current competency, and our contracts and collaboration relationships shouldn't presume that everyone already knows how to do this work well - it was a lesson we learned from the ISS experience. 

     i. Contractor's view of design participation. OSP was not fully aware of the design participation rules of engagement we had established for ourselves.

     "," OSP systems design activities were impacted as communications became an issue, program-to-program cultures clashed, and internal program integration encountered obstacles and walls. OSP achieved a level of collaboration among various centers that may be unprecedented, yet conflicts still remained. 

     Additionally:  
     a. Communication OSP Program forums did not allow for adequate discussion/questions from the implementing team members so that the basis of the marching orders could be readily understood. Questioning of direction, decisions, and policies can strengthen the rationale and buy-in. Additionally, successful implementation of Information Technology (IT) requirements for protection of competition sensitive material, resulted in the inability to quickly and effectively disseminate information to the users. 

     b. Shrinking of the Inner Circle After each occurrence of increased stress (budget cut, schedule accelerated) the &ldquo;inner circle&rdquo; of the Program Management team seemed to shrink and data flow to the mid-level managers and workers was reduced.

"625",1501,"Carr, Lisa ","Orbital Space Plane - Stay true to the process!"," The Orbital Space Plane (OSP) problems were the result of (1) a lack of a disciplined, well communicated, Level 1 requirements development process, (2) open or architecture-free Level 2 requirements, and (3) contractor-developed Level 3 requirements (system specification) Rigorous, well communicated, requirements development processes and rationale is paramount to stakeholders', technical experts' and contractors' interpretation of the requirements and promotes personal &ldquo;buy-in&rdquo;.  
      
     "," Three major contributors to the dilemma within OSP were (1) a lack of a disciplined, well communicated, Level 1 requirements development process, (2) open or architecture-free Level 2 requirements, and (3) contractor-developed Level 3 requirements (system specification). Rigorous requirements development processes consistent with accepted system engineering practices are critical to establishing a good requirements foundation. The Requirements Development Team (RDT) attempted to insert rigor during the Level 2 requirements development in a short time and with a laser-like focus. But for team members not in the laser's light, the RDT was a blackout. 

     Additionally:  
     a. Communication of Requirements. A requirements philosophy paper was written to help communicate the message. Where it failed was in limited distribution and the lack of diligence to get this message to the personnel involved after the process had started. The use of a small, co-located requirements development team (RDT) also tended to isolate people at different centers as well as the contractors from the discussion behind the requirements. This led to confusion in interpretation of the requirements by the contractors and by the Project Managers who were trying to help the contractors with the interpretation. 

     b. OCD in Parallel. Since the Operations Concept Document (OCD) was developed in parallel with the system requirements the two teams tended to focus on different areas of operation. In some instances the desires of the OCD and the requirements of the SRD were in conflict. 

     c. Multiple Level 2 Documents. Requirements controlled at the program level were contained in a number of documents; the Systems Requirements Document (SRD), the ISS/OSP Interface Requirements Document (IRD), and the Human Rating Plan (HRP). Additional verification requirements were found in the System Verification Plan. Also, some program level requirements were derived from the OCD scenarios and the ELV Interface Design Document (IDD). The locating of Level II requirements in multiple documents did not provide a comprehensive set of Level II system requirements nor provide for consistency of Level III requirements. 

     d. Too much Trade Space. The notion that &ldquo;saying less gives the contractor more freedom&rdquo; isn't entirely true. Having not worked in this environment with NASA previously, the contractors struggled to produce the requirements at Level 3. In all cases the Contractors were looking for much more guidance so they would not go down a path that would lead them to losing out on the Full Scale Development. 

     e. Minimum Standards. A minimum set of standards should have been developed to grade the contractors by and to give them a &ldquo;watermark&rdquo; to go by in the development of level 3 requirements. 

     f. Validation Issues. Validation of the system-level requirements for OSP required the use of the contractor's architecture to show that the requirements can, in fact, be met. Having multiple contractors with different architectures made this a daunting task and, due to limited personnel and time, near impossible. The validation of OSP Level 2 requirements was not adequately resolved. 

     g. Requirements Philosophy. A requirements philosophy paper was written to help communicate the message. 

     h. Level 1 Requirements. The process by which the Level 1 Requirements were developed was not clear to the program implementers. Rationale was not provided for the requirements and the resultant set of requirements was never formally transferred to OSP nor placed under configuration control. It was also indicated that pushback was not allowed. This caused major problems when early government-led trades revealed that the requirements might not be entirely feasible. The ambiguity of the requirements led OSP to create a Level 1 requirements interpretation document and place it under configuration management. However, the OSP requirements development team was not able to communicate directly with the Level 1 requirements developers in order to establish agreement on Level 1 requirements interpretation. Level 2 Requirements Development of the Level 2 requirements did not follow established systems engineering guidelines for allocation, inclusion of performance and functional
    requirements, validation, and feasibility assessments.

"628",1489,"Johnson, Leslie ","Instrument Simulators/Engineering Models"," With the advent of on-orbit reprogrammable remote sensing instruments, the need for high fidelity hardware capable of executing an identical copy of flight software or firmware for Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA)-based designs to verify and validate flight software changes prior to implementation on orbit has become a necessity. The SAGE III simulator proved itself to be an invaluable tool in expediting instrument development as well as meeting the requirement to verify and validate flight software changes prior to execution during on-orbit operations. "," The high-fidelity SAGE III simulator proved itself to be an invaluable tool in expediting instrument development as well as meeting the requirement to verify and validate flight software changes prior to execution during on-orbit operations. Specific lessons learned follow:  
      
     

      
        The SAGE III high-fidelity simulator was used to verify and validate designs prior to committing to a flight hardware build. This approach allowed designers to test their design in a less restrictive environment than required for flight hardware and correct design problems prior to building flight hardware. We believe that this approach saved time and flight hardware rework.  

        The SAGE III high-fidelity simulator facilitated flight software development. SAGE III flight software was developed in parallel with flight hardware using the high fidelity simulator. Significant schedule and costs were saved using this approach because the hardware and software development was a parallel rather than serial activity.  

        Development risk was reduced by testing flight software on engineering hardware rather than flight hardware. This approach avoided the potential situation where critical and high value flight hardware was operated using unproven flight software. The likelihood of damage to critical flight systems by errant software was avoided using this approach.  

        The high fidelity simulator proved to be invaluable during anomaly troubleshooting during integration and test. For instance, the simulator was used to isolate a hardware problem and to develop a software fix for an interface communications problem that occurred infrequently (two-three times) when the instrument was tested at cold temperatures during thermal vacuum testing. This ability allowed the environmental test program to continue in parallel with the anomaly investigation and work-around solution development.  

        The simulator was used to develop, verify, and validate flight software changes during on-orbit operations. The simulator was needed to work around problems with spacecraft provided data (navigation data and attitude data) and other problems with the flight code found during on-orbit operations but not identified during integration and testing.  

        The instrument operations team assumed responsibility for primary flight software sustaining engineering during spacecraft integration. Formal training and &ldquo;behind-the-wheel&rdquo; operation of the simulator was performed to ensure the operations team was capable and ready to perform these functions.  

        Configuration management of the simulator is required. Particular emphasis should be placed on verifying that the ground simulator configuration and software image match the flight configuration to the greatest extent possible.

     "," &ldquo;A user will tell you anything you ask about-and nothing more.&rdquo; So, OSP asked many questions, asked early, and asked often. An operational focus was applied by aligning operations equivalent to engineering in the organization and keeping flight, ground, and integrated operations engaged throughout the development. 

     Additionally: 

     a. Integrated Operations. There was recognition that the ground system must be worked in an integrated fashion with the flight system. The operations community was included in the development process from the start and direction was provided by the program manager to optimize the total system versus the vehicle. 

     b. Operators in the Acquisition. Operational conscience extends into SEB membership and all other aspects of the procurement process. The OSP SEB Voting Board members included representatives of the design and operations centers giving a more balanced experience base and perspective in procuring a better system. Committee structure included an Operations Committee with representation from the astronaut corps, the flight controllers from JSC and the ground operations personnel from KSC. 

     c. Focus on Operability. Early in the formulation phase, the OSP Program committed to placing a high emphasis on ensuring &ldquo;operability&rdquo; in the design, to reduce life cycle costs and reduce process-induced failures. When pressure was ramping up, the emphasis on operations infusion into the design fell by the wayside.

     A project must plan to be self-sufficient when working a project in a foreign country. You must provide everything that you think will be needed and then provide for those unexpected situations.  
      
     Supplies for contamination control need to be provided by the US side. It was our experience that Russian provided supplies did not meet the requirements that had been established.

     "," Credibility in cost and schedule estimating is key in convincing stakeholders that a program can execute within resource constraints. OSP recognized this issue and placed great emphasis on developing credible cost tools and models that produce credible results. Significant lack of clarity exists in operations cost models for human space flight vehicles. Models were being developed and vetted but more work is required. &ldquo;Smart buyer&rdquo; technical tools and models require a comparable emphasis. Our government evaluators must be able to independently validate contractor's analyses, tools and models. 

     Additionally: 

     a. Human Space Flight Operations Cost Model. Obtaining adequate operations cost estimates was a struggle through-out the OSP program studies. The lack of a cost modeling tool for human flight operations significantly increases the time and effort required to generate costing figures. In addition, it is difficult to provide consistent costing figures through multiple iterations/costing exercises. 

     b. Government Concept. The government concept role in the requirements analysis cycle (RAC) was clear, but its role in the design analysis cycle (DAC) was unclear. 

     c. Design Participation. Teams of NASA human spaceflight system experts and integrated system analysts should have been formed early enough to collaborate on trade study and requirement development analysis design, in order to assure the relevance of objectives and the validity of assumptions, initializing conditions, and models. 

     d. Operations Cost Model. The OSP program recognized the need for a valid Human Space Flight Operations Cost Model to support this and future human space flight programs and had begun development. Operations cost modeling tools are not available. 

     e. OSP Cost Estimating Team. The lack of cost credibility in the Space Launch Initiative (SLI) Program required a fresh approach to providing supportable, defendable, and credible life cycle cost estimates. Assembling and integrating a team of cost estimators with various backgrounds was part of the process to give credibility to OSP cost estimates.

Contractor requirements traceability matrices did not fully address the issues of requirement rationale and allocation. The number of documents delivered and the lack of clear organization for traceability of requirements hampered the milestone (SRR, SDR) review process.

Recognize that as a combined set, these requirements present program risk, because they have never been fielded into a System design. 

     Additionally:  
      
     a. Launch Vehicle Explosion and Water Survival Failure to incorporate a complete and validated set of crew survival requirements at the beginning of the program led to uncertainty and substantial architectural redesign. Accurate explosion models of the Atlas and Delta launch vehicles do not exist. 

     b. Human Rating of Expendable Launch Vehicles (ELV) The ELVs that were to launch the OSP spacecraft were defined to be within the OSP system boundary. For human-rating purposes, the OSP/ELV combinations were to be treated as a single entity with the OSP system and the ELVs were not going to be separately human rated. However, the human rating adequacy of the ELVs was not fully assessed, and it is doubtful that they would have met acceptable human rating requirements.

     Additionally:

Center Divisions When faced with infrastructure challenges, historically distributed specialties and most importantly resource allocations the organization split among center organizational boundaries.

This met the SUBSA Principal Investigator's desire to melt about 2mm into the seed. However, during SUBSA's on-orbit experiment, the flight heater unit temperature of 820 C did not melt into the seed. 

     To melt further into the seed, SUBSA tried to issue a setpoint change command to increase the Thermal Chamber's temperature.

"685",1310,"Trinh, Huu ","NASA/MSFC Army Vortex Chamber Test Incident",""," Several lessons learned are identified from the subject incident:  
     

      
        
        The excessive amount of propellants accumulated in the chamber was the main contributor to the test failure. This accumulation might have been caused by the unintended time delay in the LOX/RP-1 ignition. Consequently, the eventual ignition led to the chamber over-pressurization. 

        <ol type=""a"">
            Although GOX/GH2 torch igniters have been used in igniting LOX/RP-1 systems, the database and experience of such an igniter for the LOX/RP-1 system are limited. The use of this igniter type for LOX/RP-1 along with its location with respect to the chamber might have caused some delay time in the ignition and created the first two events as stated in the previous section. In this test sequence, LOX was injected to the chamber prior to the RP-1 injection. It has been speculated that RP-1 might have become frozen during this ignition delay. Past data indicates that frozen RP-1/LOX combustion releases an excessive energy creating an over-pressurization in the combustion chamber. Furthermore, due to the nature of the of the vortex chamber flow field, the startup transient is not well understood. For the aforementioned reasons, a better-characterized igniter, such as TEA/TEB, should be applied.  

            To detect the ignition/combustion occurrence, the vortex chamber should be monitored for an increase in pressure. The value of this increase and the detection duration depend on individual test conditions and the chamber configuration. Theoretically, it is possible to estimate these values; however, it is very difficult and tedious to accurately predict them. They are normally determined through initial hot-fire tests, which was also one of the objectives of the fourth test. For this particular test, the test duration was set for 2.00 seconds and the incident occurred at 1.38 seconds within the duration. Given the lack of data, this duration should be set conservatively at a lower value. If the duration does not allow enough time for ignition, a small incremental step can be added to the waiting time. This method, however, may require more tests in order to study the startup conditions.  
          

         &nbsp; 
        

        Historically, most traditional LOX/RP-1 chambers have used an L* (chamber volume/throat ratio) between 35 to 96 inches. The L* for this vortex chamber was approximately 12 inches. It should be mentioned that one of benefits of the vortex chamber concept is to have a small chamber. At the time of the design, this L* value was selected based on an existing Army chamber configuration for a gelled hypergolic propellant system. Later, Army engineers learned that a longer delay in ignition requires a larger chamber volume in order to eliminate the chamber over-pressurization during the startup. From the aforementioned data, a larger L* value should be considered in the final chamber configuration.  

        The Army Vortex test program did not require the IRIG time stamp on the high-speed film . Therefore, it was not active during this series of tests. Normally, the film is only processed in the event of an anamoly. In this incident, the high-speed film provided the best data of what occurred and without the time stamp it required personnel reviewing the film and manually linking the event with the test sequence and data . This method is not as precise as the IRIG method. For the future, the IRIG time stamp should be the standard without the program having to request this option.  

        Normally test articles and facilities are not instrumented for failures. In this case, the thrust measurement system constraints did not allow for close coupling of the facility and test article instrumentation and would have been fine for successful steady state tests. In the future the instrumentation requirements should be more carefully evaluated and where possible instrument for a failure while maintaining the program requirements, schedule and budget.  
      
    In conclusion, the vortex chamber design concept involves flow vortices and combustion behaviors which are not observed in conventional combustion chambers. In addition, existing numerical prediction methods may not be able to accurately predict or describe all startup transients and other phenomenal aspects, including two-phase flow, propellant mixing, flow field characteristics, etc. A conservative approach in the test article design and test planning should be taken to minimize test failure potentials. A gradual change in the hardware design and testing, leading to the eventual optimum configuration, should be considered after experience with the vortex chamber concept is gained.   
      
    Recommendations:  

      
        The vortex chamber configuration, test conditions and test sequence should be improved to minimize propellant accumulation during the ignition process. This may include:  
      

    
        An increase in the chamber volume  

        A reduction of the initial propellant injection flow rate to the chamber  

        No pre-chilling or using gaseous oxygen during the startup to ease the ignition process  

        Shortening the duration of the chamber ignition detection  
        
    </ul>

    <ol start=""2"">
        Other igniter types, such as a TEA/TEB, provide shorter ignition delays and therefore might prove to be better ignition sources. Changes in the igniter location should also be considered to minimize the ignition delay time.  

        Prior to attempting to derive the optimum combustion chamber design, a conservative approach should be taken in the hardware design and test planning. This should help to ensure that experience is gained with the vortex chamber.  

        A time stamp on the high-speed film should become the standard practice where applicable.  

        The instrumentation requirements should be more carefully evaluated and where possible instrument for a failure while maintaining the program requirements, schedule and budget.  

        The Safety Assessment included a Quantity Distance of 160 feet, based on the amount of propellant on the test stand. Fragments from the detonation traveled 480 feet. The Safety Assessment for hot fire testing should include fragmentation predictions for a detonation in the test article. The MSFC Industrial safety Department is working to acquire the necessary expertise and develop procedures for inclusion of fragmentation predictions in the Safety Assessment. This will provide for improved personnel and equipment hazard mitigation techniques.

        Not Separately Priced (NSP) services from the vendor that made them a valuable team player. Examples of NSP services include 3 site visits by knowledgeable engineers employed by the vendor after each purchase to resolve technical issues with purchased hardware; a spreadsheet maintained by the vendor listing part number, serial number and warranty data for all items delivered; guaranteed delivery dates for purchased items; and paper and CD ROM copies of all specifications, databooks, users guides, engineering notes and so forth.  
      
    All of these services were provided ""free"", but their cost was included in the price of hardware purchase.  
      
    Another benefit of this contract is that all of the paperwork is done up front. After the initial order is made against the contract, subsequent orders require very minimal paperwork. In fact, after the first order is made using a standard NASA Purchase Request form, subsequent orders can be done using a simple electronic form sent directly to the procurement office.

     The planned test conditions at the time of the mishap (M = 0.8, move the cowl down to an angle of 8*) had not been properly reviewed and assessed. Data recorded at a test condition just prior to the mishap (M=0.8, cowl fixed at 8*) indicated that these conditions resulted in a sting roll moment 26,487 in-lbs, which was above the allowable limit of 26,000 in-lbs. Also, at M = 0.8, the cowl moved down quicker than expected. This meant the operator response time to activate the cowl's brake was critical. As the cowl moved down, the operator did not activate the brake quick enough to stop the cowl at 8*; consequently, it traveled to its maximum angle of 13*. Note, conditions of M = 0.8, 13* had not been analyzed prior to testing.  
      
     With the cowl at 13*, M = 0.8, the aerodynamic loads resulted in sting loads that exceeded the sting's limits and caused the sting to deflect downward. This deflection decreased the angle of attack by a few degrees (i.e., it became more negative), which increased the aerodynamic forces even more. In other words, excessive aerodynamic forces caused sting deflection that resulted in increasing the already excessive aerodynamic forces. At this point, the aerodynamic forces caused sting loads that far exceeded the sting limits, resulting in ultimate failure of the sting.

     Note: As distance learning technology evolves other factors may need to be considered when determining the training delivery method. Advances in training technology now allow for the easy separation of development of course content and course templates (the operational look and feel of course delivery). For example, the Shared Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) has been recently developed as a standard means for packaging course content. Course content developed in accordance with this standard can be plugged into compliant training delivery systems. SCORM compliant course materials are also packaged in segments that can be used by multiple training courses. The goal being to encourage technologies that enable dynamic learning where content is custom-assembled and delivered to learners according to their own personal pace and need. This enables sharing of course content among different courses or training systems. In comparison the current SOLAR technology relies on static
    webpages specifically developed for a course/module. (The course content is not independent from the delivery system). Any reuse would require replicating the webpages and assembling them within a new course/module. Reusability of course segments or use in other training systems as in SCORM would allow development costs to be potentially spread over an even larger number of training use instances.

"818",987,"Olivier, Jean ","Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO) Development Program Programmatic ""Lessons Learned""","","  
        Stable Requirements are key to program stability. Do not allow requirements to creep. One step in this process is to involve all stakeholders in developing and finalizing requirements. Stakeholders may include potential development and operations contractors, engineering and other organizations and NASA Headquarters.  

        Plan early in the program for operations considerations, making sure the operations organization is strongly involved in defining requirements and in the early design process to assure systems are user friendly. This is not easy to accomplish for either MSFC or the contractor, particularly in a schedule and funding constrained development environment where design features to enhance operations may result in features not envisioned by the design organization.  

        To the maximum extent possible assure that the operations and verification databases, as well as, command and telemetry pneumonic are common. Often, to reduce cost, a contractor will propose the use of systems level Electrical Ground Support Equipment (EGSE) that was previously used on another program. This can make portability between operations and verification difficult, since Ground Support Equipment (GSE) Interface Control Document (ICD) is often obsolete by the time the program is ready for systems testing. Use of existing GSE may require both hardware and software upgrades.  

        The operations organization should realize from the beginning that the development program may suffer schedule erosion, and should therefore develop contingency planning for operations procedure development in an environment where the operations database is not yet finalized. Spending effort complaining about the development program being late is not productive.  

        Spend the necessary resources to provide for a strong systems engineering organization throughout the program. Assign managers for all interface control documents and layout a schedule for their development through baselining. Make sure the systems engineering manager has direct control of all manpower for systems analyses such as thermal, structural dynamics, error budgets, loads, mass properties, electrical power demand, orbital mechanics, etc. Do not overlook the need for strong systems engineering involvement in requirements and verification traceability.  

        Make sure that one organization is responsible for end-to-end systems engineering for the entire payload including the payload ground operations system. Engineering of the entire system includes penetrating the total system design on both sides of an ICD rather than working just your side of it. When responsible for building a total systems analytical model (thermal, structural, dynamic, electrical, etc.) by assembling a number of analytical inputs from other organizations, systematically check the accuracy of these inputs before using them and perform sanity tests on the total model with simple yet carefully chosen boundary conditions to make sure it is correct.  

        When verifying performance of optical elements or systems always cross check the results using another completely different test method. When required to use gravity off-loaders in the test of optical systems, it is essential that they be rigorously tested and correlated with analytical models under both nominal and off nominal conditions.  

        Maintain a strong engineering involvement with the contractor from the beginning of the program, not just when you get into trouble. Encourage a sense of ""ownership"" and continuity of responsibility for all individuals involved in the program. In the case of engineering this can be helped greatly by insuring that the same individual remains responsible for a given technical discipline throughout the program.  

        Assure that adequate funding and schedule reserve is budgeted at the beginning of the program, no less than 25% and possibly more depending on assessed technical risk.  

        Before launch of any remotely operated satellite or other equipment, perform end-to-end tests of the flight system with the ground control system using the final flight and ground versions of hardware, software, database and procedures. The flight operations team should perform these tests. To the extent possible, each command type should be sent and verified. Commands that by their nature cannot be tested in this manner should be tested in a high fidelity simulator with the ground system and all hardware commands to the flight system should be verified using the ground system for functionality.  

        Any mission critical verification that requires verification, in whole or in part, by analysis should be double checked or preferably analyzed in parallel by an independent party. This same principle should also apply to any operational commands that are generated based on analytical input.  

        To the extent that resources permit, design the system with reserve capability, including failure tolerance, beyond that stated in the requirements.  

        Never stop looking for undetected failure modes or potential risks throughout the entire program development and operational phases.  

        Hold regular status meetings by telecon with the entire program team so that all parties remain knowledgeable of program status and issues.  

        NASA management's main goal should be to provide help and guidance to their contractors. Monitoring progress is only a by-product of this effort, not its primary objective.  

        Taking shortcuts in box-level testing is a gamble with poor odds. Spend the time to thoroughly verify the flight worthiness of hardware and software at the lowest level. Finding box-level problems during systems-level testing is much more costly and disruptive in the long run.  

        If independent review teams are to be used, get them involved at Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and keep them involved in all major reviews, as well as in the resolution of critical issues as they arise throughout the program.  

        Critically evaluate any hardware or software that a contractor wants to use from another program or verify by similarity. Independently assess its specifications and how it was used in former programs, as compared with your requirements. Be particularly wary if the previous program was classified and details are not available. Insist that the contractor provide all specifications to support your evaluation.  

        Be especially cautious when dealing with highly complex scientific hardware where the developer is ""the only one that understands how it works."" This system should not be exempt from review by as knowledgeable a team of experts as you can assemble, even if they have to be brought in from another NASA center or independent organizations. For instance, the Advanced Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) CCD radiation test shortcomings may have been caught by such a team, if one had been assembled one early in the program.

Model analysis performed during this investigation suggests that with a short-duration test and with the fuel cavity contamination type and quantity observed, damage to the FPB faceplate does not necessarily occur. In other words, there exists a substantial range of contamination levels within which it is possible to effectively destroy the HPFTP without melting the FPB faceplate.

"889",981,"Sampson, Mike ","Reverse Polarity Concerns With Tantalum Capacitors",""," By nature of their construction, tantalum capacitors (both wet slug and dry slug styles) are polar devices that are susceptible to performance degradation and/or catastrophic failure if reverse biased. This behavioral characteristic has always been known, but recent experiences have reminded us of the importance of proper installation and circuit design when using this type of component. Historically, reverse polarity failures have been observed that resulted from: 

    
        Incorrect initial installation (part installed backwards)  

        Incorrect installation during rework (original part installed correctly, but replacement part put in backwards)  

        Correct circuit design, but incorrect artwork on the printed wiring board (part installed correctly according to the artwork, but actually in backwards)  

        Incorrect circuit design (printed wiring board artwork correct per circuit layout, but design error resulted in parts in backwards)  
    </ul>

     The NASA EEE Parts Assurance Group (NEPAG) is currently investigating the reverse polarity behavior of tantalum dry slug chip capacitors because there is little definitive information in the literature on this subject. Preliminary results will be available in the last quarter of 2001. 

     &nbsp; 

    <p align=""center"">   Guidelines Regarding Reverse Bias Application of Tantalum Capacitors</u>   

    <p align=""center"">  Wet Slug (Non-Solid) Tantalum Capacitors  
     Ex.- MIL-PRF-39006  
     CLR79, CLR81, CLR90 and CLR91 types   

    
        Capable of handling up to 3 volts of reverse polarity regardless of capacitor voltage rating. Leakage current characteristics will be higher than normal.  

        Exceeding 3 volts reverse bias will cause rapid deterioration of the capacitor leading to catastrophic failure (short circuit)  

        Polarity identification is generally indicated by a ""+"" or a stripe on the anode termination. Also, hermetically sealed, tubular case, wet slug styles have a crimp towards one end of the case that may be used to identify the anode (""+"") end. Exceptions or variations to these conventions may exist.  
    </ul>

    <p align=""center"">  Dry Slug (Solid) Tantalum Capacitors  
     Ex. MIL-PRF-39003 and MIL-PRF-55365  
     CSR, CSS and CWR types   

    
        Sensitive to reverse polarity but tend to be much less so than their wet slug counterparts.  

        May fail explosively under reverse bias, even catch fire.  

          May survive ""indefinitely"" at room temperature with up to 15% of their voltage rating applied in reverse.   Capacitors will have a higher leakage current than in the forward direction, but this may be undetectable in the majority of heavily derated circuit applications. The circuit may operate properly for many hours (hundreds or even thousands) before failure. Influential factors in life expectancy are believed to include: manufacturer, style, size, capacitance, moisture content and of course rated voltage.  

        ""Chip"" styles may be more vulnerable to failure under reverse bias than hermetically sealed styles because moisture may accelerate failure. NEPAG is investigating the effect of moisture.  

        
        ""Chip"" styles are more prone to being installed improperly because they may be very small and the polarity identifier can be hard to see. 

        
            Conformally coated ""chip"" styles (ex.--CWR06) typically identify the polarity by a small projection ""nub"" in the center of one termination representing the anode (+) termination  

            Molded case ""chip"" styles (ex.--CWR09 and CWR11) identify the polarity by a beveled edge in the case and/or a polarity bar marked on the case  
        </ul>
        

        Polarity identification is generally indicated by a ""+"" or a stripe adjacent to the anode termination. Exceptions or variations to these conventions may exist. One example of such an exception is the tubular case capacitor made in accordance with MIL-PRF-39003/10 which requires a stripe to identify the cathode ""-"" termination

"890",980,"Grady, Kevin ","Spacecraft Interface Simulators",""," The approach which the Project undertook was to develop simulators which electrically duplicated the spacecraft side of the interface. These simulators were then shipped to the instruments on a rotating basis. Tests were performed with instrument engineering model hardware and the flight instruments as well. These tests were performed on the flight instruments, after the flight instrument was assembled, but before the lengthy environmental and calibration test phases which complex instruments demand. This gave the instrument developers the confidence that their instrument would be compatible with the spacecraft, when the time came to integrate into the spacecraft. In doing this, it avoided the possibility of having to make a significant instrument modification, as a result of an interface incompatibility, after the instrument had been delivered. This in turn could have resulted in the need for additional regression testing (T/V, EMI/EMC) and the attendant schedule impact. 

     In addition to the benefits of isolating design or workmanship errors in the instrument's spacecraft interface early, it provided an early opportunity for the instrument teams to work in the environment that they would be seeing, after they delivered their instrument to the spacecraft facility. Command and telemetry databases were hosted on the spacecraft interface simulator, and building block procedures, which were to be executed later at spacecraft level, could be debugged at this early opportunity prior to instrument delivery. The planning and information interchange necessitated by the use of this interface simulator hardware caused spacecraft and instrument teams to become cognizant of integration and test issues much sooner than they likely would have. This led to a Terra instrument integration activity which was virtually trouble free. 

     The spacecraft interface simulators deployed during the instrument integration and test phases played an enormous role in the eventual ease of instrument integration. The Terra experience is a strong endorsement for the use of spacecraft simulators at the instrument developers' facility during instrument integration and test. This is particularly true when significant development risk resides on both sides of the interface and the complexity of the instruments is such that a significant amount of time is invested during the instrument environmental test flow.

        The ceramic bed heater is especially vulnerable to excess differential pressure across the bed. Location of the lower pressure port created a single point failure that allowed the differential pressure to develop uncontrolled. Steps which could have been taken to prevent this mishap from occurring could have been more rigorous reviews, identifying the pressure ports in the vessel as safety critical features, listing them as such on the fabrication drawings and in failure modes analyses, and assuring that inspection during construction was accomplished.  

        Formal configuration management should commence immediately following design completion. This configuration management may be tailored to the size and scope of the project. In cases of contracting for hardware or software systems, NASA should participate in or thoroughly audit the Contractors systems to assure adequate configuration controls.

This is a difficult task, but when there are many potential single-point failures and the consequences of failure is high, it is worth significant effort. Bearings and fasteners are notorious failure points (even if not highly loaded). They must be monitored, maintained, and replaced accordingly.  

        During design reviews, do not overlook parts designed by contractors even though this may be difficult for proprietary reasons.

        While environmental testing has demonstrated considerable value to spaceflight projects, such testing always carries inherent risks.  

        Test facilities must be maintained, and over time replaced as necessary, such that the test equipment is in good working order. Metrics must be developed and tracked that assess the mechanical health of the systems.  

        ""Canned"" tests should be developed and periodically utilized to provide a trended database for the test facility system response. Any deviations in the system response should be investigated.  

        Critical control system response data, such as the transfer function or inverse transfer functions and calculated drive voltage, must be evaluated real-time during vibration testing, but before application of the sine-burst to ensure that they are reasonable and do not indicate system maladies.  

        A vibration facility validation test should be done for each planned test series that is representative of the actual test conditions before flight or critical hardware is mounted. Use of a simulated mass consistent with that of the test article is always recommended for spacecraft system level testing. Other flight equipment validation testing should be considered based on mass and criticality.  

        Self-checks should be done that provide a representative response for the forcing range of the planned test. For higher force shock tests, shaker systems and test fixtures often do not respond in a linear fashion. It is also foolhardy to assume that test facilities are always in perfect working order.  

        All test requirements should be defined in the test plan for a particular test. The test operators must have adequate data and training to ensure complete verification testing before testing critical hardware.

"905",979,"Grady, Kevin ","Thruster Plume Impingement",""," Several weeks of investigation proceeded, and a significant amount of analysis and modeling were performed. It was determined that the impingement of the thruster plumes from two of the attitude thrusters were producing a large torque, by impinging on the Terra solar array. The Terra solar array is a very large flexible blanket type array. The location of the array during the maneuver resulted in the worse possible orientation for plume interaction, and it also resulted in the largest possible moment arm between the center-of-pressure and center-of-gravity. The combination of these two factors resulted in the larger than expected disturbance torque, which led to the attitude disturbance and the shutdown of the orbit raising maneuver. 

     Subsequent to numerous analyses and simulations, an optimal orientation for the solar array during the maneuvers was determined, and a modified thruster torque transformation matrix were developed. The torque transformation matrix accounted for the residual disturbance which was still induced, even with the solar array in the optmized orientation. 

     A series of smaller orbit raising maneuvers were performed to verify the software changes. The maneuvers executed without problems. Long duration maneuvers were then performed. These maneuvers were likewise successful. Terra reached its operational orbit and began flying in formation with Landsat 7 in February 2000. 

     Upon reviewing the process on why this error was not detected before launch, it was determined that no direct modeling of the plume impingement phenomena was ever performed. Plume effects were accounted for via a design allocation process; however, the torque that was allocated in the design process was inadequate. The allocation was not verified via a closed-loop simulation simulation. 

     This experience reaffirms the value of performing high fidelity 3-axis simulations prior to launch. This is particularly true as spacecraft grow, and surface areas become larger. The utility of high fidelity 3-axis simulations is unquestionable, and should be performed as a routine and continuous part of the spacecraft design process.

"906",978,"Grady, Kevin ","End-to-End Testing",""," The Terra development schedule had always planned to perform end-to-end testing between the spacecraft and the EOS control center as soon as the ground system was capable of such testing. The initial test between the satellite and the ground system was in fact conducted while the spacecraft was in spacecraft-level thermal/vacuum test. The Terra housekeeping command and control links were exercised, just prior to completion of the Terra thermal/vacuum test. Due to unforeseen problems in the launch vehicle and the ground system, this initial test would prove to be almost two years before the launch of Terra. 

     When the decision was made to change the implementation of the Terra ground system, due to the fact that a number of technical problems were not reaching resolution, the resolve to execute rigorous end-to-end testing became even more critical. A decision was made in the fall of 1998 to incorporate a new control center software package. The software was planned for completion in the spring, with the launch of Terra scheduled for the summer. 

     Schedule pressures could have forced a lesser amount of allocated time for end-to-end testing, however the Project adopted the philosophy that no rigor be compromised, and a comprehensive test flow was adopted. Where early testing was possible with preliminary deliveries of the ground software, the philosophy was to always regression test when a subsequent software delivery became available. 

     The spacecraft and ground teams performed tremendously in spite of difficult and challenging circumstances. Both S-band and Ku-band tests were executed, using the NASA Compatibility Test Van (CTV) which had been shipped to the launch site for this very purpose. The early orbit mission activities were tested and retested, validating the hardware, software, and perhaps most importantly the people. 

     The lesson learned from the success of Terra's early communications success, is that there is no substitute for real life end-to-end testing. In Terra's unique circumstances, it placed a tremendous demand on the spacecraft and ground systems personnel who had to complete the software development, launch preparations and end-to-end testing on a compressed schedule. All who were involved with Terra will agree that there should be no compromise when it comes to such critical tests between the flight and ground segments.

"907",1084,"Johnson, Suzanne ","Mishap Investigation Board Report Findings for the GSFC Building 24 Pressurized Steam Line Close Call of August 19, 1999"," The primary cause of this Central Power Plant (CPP) pressurized steam line incident was that no one took responsibility for coordinating all aspects of executing the outage. 

     Recommendations included revising procedures, conducting an independent safety audit of the CPP, Developing as-built drawings for the CPP, and establishing &ldquo;Locked And Tagged Out&rdquo; processes and requirements. "," The primary cause of the pressurized steam line incident was that no one took responsibility for coordinating all aspects of executing the outage. Each group involved in the outage focused on what they believed to be their role and did not concern themselves with what the other groups were doing. Consequently, issues that required a coordinated effort such as blowing down the de-energized lines or informing the contractor when it was safe to commence work were not adequately addressed. The MIB believes that if one person/organization had coordinated the entire job, the contractors would not have started jack-hammering before the steam line was de-energized. A second primary cause of this incident is that is that no procedures exist for shutting down the north High Pressure Steam (HPS) line in the CPP and no prior planning occurred. Workers had to trace the steam line the day of the outage to determine what valves to close. Their efforts were hindered by such contributing causes
    as unlabeled valves, no visual pressure indicators on the line, inadequate access to the valves and a leaking valve. This resulted in the line not being completely de-energized until after the contractors had completed their shift for the day. Corrective Action Plans from past mishap investigations must be implemented in a timely manner and the actions sustained over time. 

     No clearly identified leader to coordinate all aspects of a task involving multiple organizations can result in a failure to communicate safety-critical information that could prevent a mishap. Such tasks should have a clearly identified leader who has the responsibility of coordinating all aspects of the job and communicating safety-critical information to all personnel involved in the task. 

     Outdated or inaccurate facility drawings/documentation and poor labeling of a facility such as the CPP increases the difficulty of accomplishing tasks of all levels of complexity and therefore increases the likelihood of errors and mistakes that could result in a mishap. Accurate and up-to-date drawings/documentation and clear labeling of such facilities on the other hand, assist workers in understanding the detailed design and operations of the facilities and therefore minimize the likelihood or errors and mistakes. 

     Division safety guidance documents should be reviewed periodically and updated to reflect changes in NASA/GSFC safety policies, organizational structure or evolved ways of doing business. ","GSFC",2000-03-24,"Science, ",FALSE,"",949,1,NA,"https://nen.nasa.gov/web/11/viewall/-/viewall/1084"
"908",1085,"Johnson, Suzanne ","Mishap Investigation Board Report Findings for the GSFC Building 3/13/14 Electrical Manhole Close Call of December 26, 1998"," An attendant left workers unattended in an electrical manhole, suggesting a lax attitude towards confined space guidelines. 

     Improve training, audit, and onsite management of high voltage electrician employees. "," The primary cause of the electrical manhole incident is an error in judgment made by the attendant that left the workers in the manhole unattended. The Mishap Investigation Board (MIB) identified two contributing causes. Testimony indicated that non-adherence to the Code 220 confined space guidelines was the norm in this organization at the time of this incident. This mode of operation was either condoned by or unknown to management. All workers involved in the incident had received some confined space training; however records indicated that it was not complete or recent. The attendant had not received training while a GSFC employee. The MIB believes that inadequate training contributed to the relaxed attitude of employees towards adherence to the confined space entry guidelines, which in turn contributed to the attendant's decision. 

     A lax attitude towards safety has a cumulative effect: Lapses in OSHA-required training leads to non-adherence to important safety-related practices and to employees that do not have safety upper most in their minds. New employees get the impression that safety is not all that important. Lapses in adhering to safety requirements and/or enforcement of adhering to safety requirements leads to the perception that the rules are not based on a real need to prevent mishaps (i,.e., we never follow the rules and nothing bad happens). Eventually, these lapses will result in a mishap. ","GSFC",2000-03-24,"Science, ",FALSE,"",950,20,NA,"https://nen.nasa.gov/web/11/viewall/-/viewall/1085"
"909",1086,"Johnson, Suzanne ","Lack of Close Call Reporting and Corrective Action Development at GSFC"," The incidents described in Lessons Learned #1084 and #1085 suggest a lack of awareness of what constitutes a close call and the fact that close calls should be reported into the NASA Mishap Reporting System. 

     The lesson recommendations include a number of steps to provide more specific safety guidance, including definition of what constitutes a &ldquo;close call.&rdquo;  
     "," The primary cause of the lack of close call reporting of these incidents was a lack of awareness of what constitutes a close call and the fact that close calls should be reported into the NASA Mishap Reporting System via the 1627 Form. Personnel involved in the pressurized steam line incident were unaware that the 1627 Form should have been submitted. The delayed submittal of this form was due to the pending appointment of the MIB. Personnel involved in the electrical manhole incident did not believe it was a close call. The MIB identified two significant contributing causes to these perceptions. The Code 220, Code 227 and NASA level guidance documents on close call/mishap reporting as well as the mishap Form 1627 itself focus on mishaps. Most of the guidance provided is mishap-specific such as attending to the injured and securing the scene, things that do not typically exist in close calls. While Code 220 and 227 guidance do require close call reporting, testimony indicated
    that it had become common practice to address close calls as an internal issue (in the branch/section in which they occurred) and not pass the information up the management chain or to the GSFC Safety and Environmental Branch. 

     Corrective actions were developed for both of these close call incidents. However, in the pressurized steam line incident the corrective actions were not adequate to prevent recurrence since they did not address the root causes of the incident. 

     Employees cannot follow policies they are not aware of or are not clear. Even though NASA policies do require the reporting of close calls into the NASA mishap reporting system, if that information is not passed on to all employees in an easily understood and visible manner it will not be followed. 

     Resolution of close calls is best accomplished through close cooperation between the organization in which the close call occurred and the Center's safety organization. Each organization brings unique knowledge skills and abilities to the table that can be used to determine what went wrong and what can be done to prevent recurrence. 

     If close calls are not investigated and addressed in a timely manner, the possible benefits derived from them (i.e., preventing mishaps caused by similar events) are lost. 

     Lack of Knowledge of What Constitutes a Close Call: In both the Pressurized Steam Line and Electrical Manhole close calls, a general lack of knowledge of the definition of what constitutes a close call was evident. Witnesses testified in both cases that they did not consider the incidents close calls. In the Steam line case, the Mechanical Maintenance Shop (MMS) worker did consider it a close call and did report it to his supervisor (as required) and the Safety and Environmental Branch (Code 205.2). The MMS supervisor informed the General Foreman and he brought the MMS and CPP groups together to solve the issue. They were not aware that a close call should be reported on a NASA Mishap Reporting Form (1627 Form). The MMS workers expected Code 205.2 to investigate and assist in resolving the issue. Code 205.2 expected Code 220 to file the 1627 Form and take action to resolve the issue. When the 1627 Form was filled out 2 months later it appears to have been done without the
    information originally provided to Code 205.2 by the MMS worker. In the Electrical manhole incident, the supervisor did not consider the incident a close call and therefore did not consider taking any official action. 

     Discussion of Close Call Reporting In Guidance Documents: The MIB reviewed the following documents to determine if they provided adequate instructions on how to handle close calls: A) Code 227 Safety Manual, Reference E; B) GSFC Facilities Management Division (Code 220) Safety and Health Program Plan (S&amp;HPP), Reference F; C) NPD 862 1.1.G, NASA Mishap Reporting and Investigating Policy, Reference A; and D) NHB; 1700.1 (-VI-B), NASA Safety Policy and Requirements Document, Reference B. 

     In general, the documents coverage of close calls is sparse. Close calls are identified as being one of the types of incidents covered, however, the majority of the guidance focuses heavily on aspects of mishaps that are not part of close calls (i.e., injuries, emergency situations). Discussion of close call reporting in the Code 227 Safety Manual is particularly unclear. A close call or near miss is not separately defined but is included as part of an incident definition. The steps to be taken by personnel involved in incidents and their supervisors focus on mishaps. This could lead readers to believe that close calls are not included in reporting policies. The Code 220 S&amp;HPP's discussion of close calls is nearly identical to that included in NPD 8621.1G and NHB 1700.1 (VI-B). All of these documents specify that close calls are to be included in reporting policies and on the 1627 Form. 

     Mishap Reporting Form: The NASA Mishap Report form (1627 Form) is also geared primarily towards mishaps. The only indication that the form is also used for reporting close calls is one box to be checked. The rest of the form is focused on reporting injuries and equipment damage, items not normally a part of close calls. The form design could mislead employees into believing that it is not for close calls, only mishaps. 

     GSFC Close Call Hazard Reporting System: During the course of interviews the Board asked witnesses about their knowledge of the new GSFC Close Call Hazard Reporting System. Most witnesses were aware of the new system and felt it to be easier to use than the 1627 form for close call reporting. The MIB concurs with this assessment. 

     Fear of Reprisals: Several Witnesses expressed an unwillingness to report close calls due to the fear of reprisals. Contractors were concerned with losing future contracts if they reported civil servants caused close calls. Even if contractors did it anonymously, they feared that it could still be ascertained who submitted the report. Note these 2 incidents the MIB investigated were submitted anonymously through the NSRS system but several witnesses were convinced they knew who the submitter was, and their guesses were different. Therefore, even anonymous submittals may have a negative impact on the submitter (or on those thought to be the submitter). 

     Lack of Corrective Actions Development: The MIB found that corrective actions were developed in both incidents commensurate: with the supervisor's perception of the incident and its level of severity. In the pressurized steam line incident, the corrective actions listed on the mishap report form were not adequate to address the incident. The actions called for the development of a Standard Operating Procedure for face-to-face meetings between Mechanical Maintenance Shop (MMS) and Central Power Plant (CPP) personnel when outages involve both shops, the incorporation of that procedure into the branch safety manual and refresher training for all personnel in lock out/tag out procedures. Face-to-face meetings did occur the day of the incident and did not prevent it. While lock out/tag out was not done correctly during the incident, that fact did not contribute to the failure to inform the contractor that the lines were not secured or the failure to secure the lines in a timely
    manner. In addition, the MIB could find no evidence that the corrective actions had been completed. In the electrical manhole incident the corrective actions were appropriate. ","GSFC",2000-03-24,"Science, ",FALSE,"",951,29,NA,"https://nen.nasa.gov/web/11/viewall/-/viewall/1086"

"952",906,"Crosby, Donald ","AMSU-B EMI/EMC System Level Testing","","  
        The key lesson here is not a new one. Ground testing should be done in the same configuration in which you will fly. The normal on-orbit operating mode for AMSU-B is scanning. However, during much of the spacecraft level EMI/EMC testing on the NOAA-K spacecraft, the AMSU-B instrument was tested in a non-scanning mode due to a ground test, antenna bearing operating time restriction. Even though there were restrictions on the ground operating time of the instrument in the scan mode, more time could have been allocated for EMI/EMC system level testing. It is important to test all flight hardware in as near flight conditions as possible to avoid on-orbit surprises.  

        The second lesson here is to carefully and thoroughly review all of your test data. In reviewing the spacecraft level EMI/EMC data again after the flight anomaly was noted, it was discovered that during the times the instrument was scanning, interference was visible in the data. The instrument was also tested by itself before delivery to the spacecraft and interference should have been detected there also.  

        The third lesson is that in the design of space flight hardware, care must be taken to assure that whenever possible, hardware can be adequately tested on the ground before launch. In the case of AMSU-B, the manufacturer of the instrument was concerned that bearing lubricant would degrade through oxidation while operating at ambient pressure. They therefore imposed a ground test operating time limit on the instrument. Other lubricants and/or designs were available that would have eliminated this constraint.

     The Board has concluded that there were no anomalies on-board the SOHO spacecraft but that a number of ground errors led to the major loss of attitude experienced by the spacecraft. 

     The first two errors were contained in predefined command sequences executed from the Ground System, while the last error was a decision to send a command to the spacecraft in response to unexpected telemetry. The sequence of these errors and their relationship to the triggered-ESRs are graphically depicted in Diagram 1.

     This series of events was preceded by a routine calibration of the spacecraft's three roll gyros. As stated earlier, the gyros are not required during most of the mission. They are used for thruster-based activities such as momentum management, ISA, and ESR. 

     Since the gyro calibration in the compressed timeline is immediately followed by the execution of momentum management, the previously employed procedure to despin the gyros at the end of the gyro calibration and to re-enable the on-board software gyro control function was not required. Following gyro calibration, Gyro A was specifically deactivated (despun) in order to conserve its life, while Gyros B and C remained fully active. Due to an omission in the modified predefined command sequence actually used, the onboard software function that activates the gyro needed by ESR was not enabled. This omission resulted in the removal of the functionality of the normal safe mode and ultimately caused the catastrophic sequence of events. 

     Following the momentum management maneuver, Gyro B, which is used for fault detection, was erroneously left in its high gain setting, resulting in an indicated roll rate of 20 times greater than actual. The incorrect gain was due to an error in another predefined command sequence; this error resulted in an on-board fault detection output that triggered an ESR. This ESR, the 5th since launch, occurred at 7:16 PM EDT (23:16 UT), June 24, 1998. 

     During ESR-5, the control Gyro A was not active because of the first error referenced above; however, there is no evidence or belief that any anomalous spacecraft behavior had occurred. As per design, the ESR event resulted in a reconfiguration of the gyros. Gyro A replaced Gyro C as the roll gyro used for the ESR thruster-based control mode, while Gyro B remained configured as the fault detection gyro. The error in Gyro B's gain was discovered and corrected, but the Gyro A despun status was not identified. 

     After transitioning to the ISA mode as part of the normal ESR recovery sequence, the attitude control system began integrating the gyro drift rate bias associated with the still despun Gyro A. After 15 minutes, this resulted in roll thruster firings intended to null the apparent (but non-existent) roll attitude error. In less than one minute, the roll rate was sufficiently high to trigger the Gyro B based fault detection once again, resulting in ESR-6 at 10:35 PM EDT (02:35 UT), June 24, 1998. 

     Although the spacecraft remained Sun-pointing within nominal limits and was therefore in a power-positive and thermally-safe attitude, the state of the spacecraft was precarious at this point in time. It had an anomalous roll rate and was depending on a deactivated gyro for roll control in both ESR and ISA modes. The personnel on the ground were not aware of either of these facts at that time. Gyro C was correctly configured to the ACU since the reconfiguration at ESR-5. Gyro B was active and on-line for fault detection, and it was correctly measuring the anomalous roll rate. A rapid decision was made that Gyro B was faulty because its output disagreed with the rate indicated by Gyro A. This decision led to the commanding off of Gyro B. 

     During ESR-6 recovery, Ground Operations commanded the spacecraft to ISA mode. In ISA, the attitude control system resumed firing roll thrusters in an attempt to null the attitude error associated with the electrical rate bias term of the despun Gyro A. Gyro B and the associated fault detection were now inactive. The increasing roll rate eventually resulted in pitch and yaw Sun-pointing errors that exceeded a prescribed limit of five degrees, resulting in ESR-7 at 12:38 AM EDT (04:38 UT), June 25, 1998. Due to the gyroscopic cross-coupling torques caused by pitch and yaw thruster firings, and the absence of true roll rate indications, the ESR controller was no longer stable, and the spacecraft attitude diverged. The incorrect diagnosis of a Gyro B fault and the subsequent ground response to this diagnosis ultimately resulted in loss of attitude control, subsequent loss of telemetry, and loss of power and thermal control. Loss of telemetry occurred at 12:43:56 AM EDT (04:43:56
    UT), June 25, 1998. It can not be determined whether this loss was a consequence of insufficient power or a loss of communication link caused by spacecraft attitude. 

     At any time during the over five hour emergency situation, the verification of the spinning status of Gyro A would have precluded the mishap. 

     For further information, a more detailed timeline summarizing the sequence of events leading up to the mishap is provided in Appendix C. A detailed fault tree analysis supporting the above scenario and the Board's conclusions has been performed by MMS and is on file.

"955",641,"Rutledge, Pete ","Mars Climate Orbiter Mishap Investigation Board - Phase I Report",""," The MCO Mishap Investigation board (MIB) has determined that the root cause for the loss of the MCO spacecraft was the failure to use metric units in the coding of a ground software file, ""Small Forces,"" used in trajectory models. Specifically, thruster performance data in English units instead of metric units was used in the software application code titled SM_FORCES (small forces). A file called Angular Momentum Desaturation (AMD) contained the output data from the SM_FORCES software. The data in the AMD file was required to be in metric units per existing software interface documentation, and the trajectory modelers assumed the data was provided in metric units per the requirements. 

     During the 9-month journey from Earth to Mars, propulsion maneuvers were periodically performed to remove angular momentum buildup in the on-board reaction wheels (flywheels). These Angular Momentum Desaturation (AMD) events occurred 10-14 times more often than was expected by the operations navigation team. This was because the MCO solar array was asymmetrical relative to the spacecraft body as compared to Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) which had symmetrical solar arrays. This asymmetric effect significantly increased the Sun-induced (solar pressure-induced) momentum buildup on the spacecraft. The increased AMD events coupled with the fact that the angular momentum (impulse) data was in English, rather than metric, units, resulted in small errors being introduced in the trajectory estimate over the course of the 9-month journey. At the time of Mars insertion, the spacecraft trajectory was approximately 170 kilometers lower than planned. As a result, MCO either was destroyed in the
    atmosphere or re-entered heliocentric space after leaving Mars' atmosphere. 

     The Board recognizes that mistakes occur on spacecraft projects. However, sufficient processes are usually in place on projects to catch these mistakes before they become critical to mission success. Unfortunately for MCO, the root cause was not caught by the processes in-place in the MCO project. 

     A summary of the findings, contributing causes and MPL recommendations are listed below. These are described in more detail in the body of this report along with the MCO and MPL observations and recommendations.

        Establish a review board of technical experts, primarily in the payload area, who are not project staff. Retain the same people on the board for the duration of the development phase. This board worked in an open and trusting environment with the CIT Payload Management office, the Instrument Development Teams, APL and the GSFC Project Office. The board had a very significant impact on the ability of a number of ACE instruments to be successfully completed on time and within budget.

            Include FOT key personnel in the early phases of the spacecraft development in order to assist in the formulation of systems operations concepts and to influence the operations (and test) philosophy.

This approach paid big dividends.  
          
        

        Coordinate project reviews in conjunction with other NASA centers. Use a dual Chairman approach in the implementation of these reviews so as to reduce the total number of reviews needed.

Failure to adequately consider fatigue in the design of structural and mechanical components subject to fluctuating loads may, at best, result in recurring costs for repair or replacement of components before their intended design life. At worst, a catastrophic failure, in terms of economic loss and loss of life, may result. 

     It is standard JSC engineering practice to specify fracture control requirements on structural and mechanical components that are classified as fracture critical. As a part of these requirements, it is required that a component be shown by analysis or test to be able to survive a deterministic minimum number of service lifetimes (usually 4) without the largest possible undetectable flaw growing to failure [references 11 and 12]. While this process has proven to be adequate to ensure against failure, design practices which do not take advantage of stochastic methods for fracture analysis may produce over-conservative and uneconomical structures and mechanisms.

    Adverse effects of electrostatic charges on space vehicle design, development, test and operation sometimes have been serious. Such effects include inadvertent ignition of electroexplosive devices, spurious triggering of electronics, and damage to insulating materials. The ignition, by electrostatic discharge, of the final stage solid rocket motor of the Delta launch vehicle for the Orbiting Solar Observatory spacecraft during test operations killed three men in 1964. Electrostatic discharges previously had ignited a similar motor without loss of life. In addition, failures of several vehicles after launch have been attributed to electrostatic discharges. 

     Electrostatic discharges in the atmosphere can have adverse effects on launch operation. NASA SP-8084, revision of June 1974, gives models that should be applied to electrostatic problems. The lightning strikes on Apollo 12, shortly after liftoff, caused major disturbances to on-board electrical systems. Fortunately, most of the effects in this case were of a temporary nature and the mission was able to continue.

Therefore, it is important that cable shielding be included in the early design of hardware. 

     Significant interference problems can occur on orbit that were not corrected during ground testing or were not found due to hardware interference situations that could not be exactly duplicated during ground testing. Also, deterioration or partial failure of components and parts can result in increased levels of radiated emissions. Hardware that is susceptible to these radiated emissions can exhibit problems such as microprocessor resets, false or inaccurate engineering data readouts, unintentional mode changes, and noisy or lost scientific data. Cable shielding minimizes these interference problems by isolating hardware from radiated emissions. 

     Numerous EMC tests at GSFC have demonstrated that unshielded cables and wires such as power leads, thermistor, and thermostat leads pick up radiated emission signals and re-radiate them from all areas of a payload. Additionally, the signals are often conducted inside shielded boxes.

    As an example of noncompliance, consider a spacecraft bus, containing critical electronic parts, whose shear plate and thermal blanket are adjacent (i.e., not separated by the standoff which characterizes a suitable two-surface particle shield). The largest incident particle, namely that for which the area-fluence product is near unity (ref. Table 1) is then, for long-duration missions in low Earth orbit or in the inner solar system, capable of penetrating the electronics housing or of producing spallation from the inner surface. In either case a single impact introduces numerous fast-moving fragments into the electronics themselves, several electronic parts will be disabled simultaneously, and the probability is high that the subsystem's function will be severely compromised, resulting in mission failure if the subsystem is critical. Even if redundant assemblies are provided, they should not be packaged together, because one particle impact may destroy them both. Even if packaged
    separately, the likelihood of two impacts (of a penetrating particle) is only modestly smaller than that of one impact, so that redundancy is a far more expensive and less effective option than the provision of suitable particle impact shielding in the first place.

"," Figure 1 shows an analysis of a typical radio and digital subsystem for a flight instrument with a 3- year mission, no redundancy (except TWTs), and partial redundancy in critical circuits for both Class S and B parts. The parts count method provided in MIL-HDBK-217E was applied. These calculations are not considered accurate for any usage in an absolute sense, due to other design and test factors the database cannot estimate. However, relative comparisons are very useful and accurate for tradeoff studies of effects of redundancy and parts classifications.

     The data are presented in graphical format for ease of understanding. On each plot, the basic reliability for the assumed conditions is plotted on the left ordinate, years are plotted on the abscissa, and the ratio of the analyzed condition is plotted on the right ordinate. 

     In a single-string (nonredundant) design like Figure 1, the decline in system reliability over time is much less for a system built entirely of Class S parts than if it were built of Class B parts. The ratio of the two reliabilities for a 5-year mission indicates the system built of Class S parts is 50 times more reliable than the system built of Class B parts. 

     When critical system circuits are made redundant, the time dependent reliability with both Class S and B parts is improved, but the improvement for the system built with B parts is greater (Figure 2). However, the 5-year mission reliability for the system built with B parts is still 20 times less than for the system built with Class S parts.

Additionally, the return on reliability, addressing non-random failures, is higher for Class S parts than for redundancy used with Class B parts.

"1222",637,"Card, Michael ","Wide-Field Infrared Explorer (WIRE) Mishap Investigation Board",""," The WIRE Mishap Review Board has determined that the telescope instrument cover was ejected earlier than planned and at approximately the time the WIRE pyro electronics box was first powered on. The instrument's solid hydrogen cryogen supply started to sublimate faster than planned, causing the spacecraft to spin up to a rate of sixty revolutions per minute over the twelve hours following the opening of the secondary cryogen vent. Without any solid hydrogen remaining, the instrument could not perform its observations. 

     The root cause of the WIRE mission loss is a digital logic design error in the instrument pyro electronics box. The transient performance of components was not adequately considered in the box design. The failure was caused by two distinct mechanisms that, either singly or in concert, result in inadvertent pyrotechnic device firing during the initial pyro electronics box power-up. The control logic design utilized a synchronous reset to force the logic into a safe state. However, the start-up time of the Vectron crystal clock oscillator was not taken into consideration, leaving the circuit in a non-deterministic state for a time sufficient for pyrotechnic actuation. Likewise, the startup characteristics of the Actel A1020 FPGA were not considered. These devices are not guaranteed to follow their ""truth table"" until an internal charge pump ""starts"" the part. These uncontrolled outputs were not blocked from the pyrotechnic devices' driver circuitry. There has been no evidence or
    indication of any component failure although component failures were considered in the investigation. 

     A significant contributing cause of the anomaly was the failure to identify, understand, and correct the electronic design of the pyro electronics box. Design errors in the circuitry, which controlled pyro functions, were not identified. The pyro electronics box design was not peer reviewed, and other system reviews conducted by the instrument design organization did not focus on the electronics box. At the time the Systems Design Review was conducted for WIRE the design of the pyro electronics box was not completed. It is the assessment of the WIRE Mishap Investigation Board that a peer review held during the design process, by people with knowledge of and expertise regarding pyro circuit design would have identified the turn-on characteristics that led to failure. 

     A large number of failure scenarios were evaluated during the investigation to determine the cause of the cover ejection. These included; pre-launch, launch, powered flight, separation, software, operations, design and component reliability faults. Based on comprehensive, systematic review of data, it was determined the cover was most likely ejected at the time the WIRE pyro electronics box was turned on due to a transient condition that exists in the pyro electronics during startup. This transient condition is the direct result of the non-deterministic initialization of a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) that controls both the arming and firing circuits in the pyro electronics. 

     Although some design attention was given to the startup behavior of the FPGA, the design contained unidentified idiosyncrasies that triggered the cover ejection. The system design did not contain sufficient start-up lockout protection or independent provisions to prevent the FPGA startup operation from propagating to the firing circuits. 

     The anomalous characteristics of the pyro electronics unit were not detected during subsystem or system functional testing due to the limited fidelity and detection capabilities of the electrical ground support equipment. Post-flight circuit analyses conducted as part of the failure investigation have predicted the existence of the anomaly and it has been reproduced confidently using engineering model hardware.

The choice of the selected valve was driven by what was available in the marketplace, and by spacecraft constraints, cost, and schedule. In order to meet instrument needs, it was necessary to operate the valve outside of manufacturer's recommendations. COTS products should be carefully chosen to be consistent with system defined specifications. Testing or analysis should be performed to identify and understand risks, to the COTS as well as to the mission goals, associated with operating COTS in other than recommended manner.  

        <i><u>Use of Emerging Technology:</u></i> The selected valve was an immature, emerging-technology product line and was available through only one vendor. The original vendor is no longer producing the valve and has no remaining in-house expertise to support on-orbit anomaly analysis and resolution. Risk is expected when dealing with emerging technology; however, the customer should attempt to mitigate these risks by fully investigating the stability of the supplier, the future market of the product, and the future availability of engineering analysis support.  

        <i><u>COTS Workmanship:</u></i> Pre-mission analysis indicated inconsistent workmanship on the 3 analyzed valves. Risk mitigation was put in place on the customer side by a filtering, selection process complemented by an extensive ground test program. Additional effort should be considered to mitigate risk by partnering with the vendor to improve vendor workmanship prior to customer delivery to provide a higher quality product and/or to include an opportunity for customer inspection before a non-recoverable process (e.g., final sealing) is performed.  

        <i><u>On-orbit Mitigation:</u></i> Although the valves were recognized as a high risk element of the instrument development, no analysis was performed on a low-cost, possibly degraded, on-orbit gas control mechanism to fall back on in case of on-orbit valve failure. Given overall mission constraints, this was consistent with the approach taken for ACE. However, it is generally recommended that pre-mission analysis should include evaluation of most probable failures and the identification of low cost, degraded on-orbit back-up approaches that could result in continuing science taking in a potentially degraded mode at marginal cost.  

        <i><u>Consequence of Additional Risks of Faster, Better, Cheaper (FBC) Mission Environment:</u></i> In order to meet the spacecraft limitations, cost, and schedule envelope to fly in the FBC environment, Projects must at times accept higher risk associated with emerging technology, non-space qualified parts, and/or COTS products. Failures, likely to become more frequent in this paradigm, should be expected, accepted, and built upon as a resource to mitigate future mission risks. Required emerging technology such as these low power, low mass micro-valves should be identified to NASA technology programs as a technology to be selected for future initiatives to allow some level of test, verification, and improvement prior to operational flight.

     The Board also discovered numerous other factors that contributed to the environment that allowed the direct causes to occur. While the direct causes were the most visible reasons for the failure, the Board believes that the indirect causes were also very significant contributors. Many of these factors can be attributed to a lack of a mutual understanding between the contractor and the Government as to what is meant by Faster, Better, Cheaper. These indirect contributors are to be taken in the context of implementing a program in the Faster, Better, Cheaper mode:

"1537",1604,"Bowers, Al ","F-18 High Alpha Research Vehicle Lessons Learned"," The F-18 High Alpha Research Vehicle has proven to be a useful research tool with many unique capabilities. Many of these capabilities are to assist in characterizing flight at high angles of attack, while some provide significant research in their own right. Of these, the thrust vectoring system, the unique ability to rapidly reprogram flight controls, the reprogrammable mission computer, and a reprogrammable On-Board-Excitation-System have allowed an increased utility and versatility of the research conducted. Because of this multi-faceted approach to research in the high angle of attack regime, the capabilities of the F-18 High Alpha Research Vehicle were designed to cover as many high alpha technology bases as the program would allow. These included aerodynamics, controls, handling qualities, structures, instrumentation, flight avionics systems, and propulsion. To achieve these goals, new capabilities were developed to enable this research to occur some were outstandingly successful; others were not.  
     "," 1. Use of an all-inclusive steering committee of all the stakeholders was an outstanding asset to the execution of the program. Being all inclusive meant all voices were heard, and even when unanimous decisions were not reachable, consensus was achieved, which maintained long term viability of the program and the project. Frequent communication was essential for this to happen within the steering committee.  
      
    2. Insufficient systems approach to the facilities, equipment, and planning occurred. Despite having extensive experience within the team with systems engineering, insufficient excess capacity was designed into the system because the entire lifecycle was not understood at inception. Requirements creep resulted in taking additional time, effort, and energy to incorporate research which was not mature at the start of the design.  
      
    3. Careful attention to risk management, both programmatic and technical, was a valuable asset in every phase of the program. In particular, sensitivity to the aircraft systems was paramount.  
      
    3a. In one instance, the aircraft's flight control computers failed to pass the Built-In Test on several occasions during the Day-of-Flight checks before passing the Built-In Test. As the pilot and crew continued the preparation for flight, several engineers in the control room stopped, took stock of the situation, and decided to cancel the mission until the reason for the failures was understood for the aircraft not passing the Built-In Test.  
      
    3b. In another instance, the Spin Recovery System (spin parachute) was reinstalled on the aircraft. The convention at that time was to fire the chute system from a benign flight condition as a system test. In most spin parachute systems, there is a small (but finite) potential for loss of the aircraft if the chute cannot be jettisoned. In the case of the F-18 HARV, the project team decided to fire the chute on the ground in a high-speed taxi test only (this was done twice) and to NOT fire the system in-flight as a system test. This reduced the risk exposure to the aircraft and flight crew, while still testing the system in a representative environment. It should be noted that two other high angle of attack programs decided to fire the spin parachute in-flight as a system test (X-29A and X-31A).  
      
    3c. As well as making careful estimates for improvements and changes, be sure to define, well in advance and with careful planning, the deletion of specific envelope expansion hardware (or safety hardware). This needs to be carefully coordinated as part of the continuing airworthiness and flight safety process. In the case of the F-18 HARV, after the envelope expansion was complete, the need for the spin recovery system and the emergency power systems (battery back-ups, another system that was tested and demonstrated in ground tests) could have been removed from the aircraft. A current example might be the Fight Termination System onboard a UAV, or a system augmentation of the Flight Termination System.  
      
    4. Testing, both ground and flight, always uncovers deficiencies and contingencies that need to be planned in. This is true in the integration phase, but also (and in particular with one-of-a-kind research systems) in the flight phase. One aspect of this was the use of carrying extra flight cards in the briefed cards for a mission. Even though we knew we could not achieve all the test points, excess cards were always carried. If one piece of instrumentation failed during a mission, then other cards could be substituted and a full mission could be flown. Up to 140% of a mission's cards would be carried on every mission. Having these contingencies in mind during planning is useful as well. If a particular flight control load developed unforeseen problems, a previous load (for which lower priority test points are still waiting to be flown) can be reloaded and lower priority missions continue while the unforeseen difficulties are resolved. The ground testing of the system wa greatly streamlined by the presence of the Hardware-in-the-Loop simulation residing at Dryden. The hardware simulation, being co-located with the aircraft and the research team, minimized impacts to the schedule.  
      
    5. Use of a Class B envelope for Class B software (flight control laws) is very useful. However, careful attention needs to be paid to the corners of the Class B envelope to assure that, truly, the envelope is Class B. In particular, the lower right corner (for static structural loads) and the upper right corner (for flutter), and the upper left corner (for aeroservoelastics). Class B software is quickly reconfigurable, and flexible.

        Sparks and hot chips generated during the cutting operations apparently came to rest in a hidden area, created a hot spot, and, approximately 90 minutes after cutting operations were completed, the hot spot ignited into a full fire. Fire watches normally cease one hour after cutting operations are ended. Under certain circumstances, such as those found in this situation, existing procedures may be inadequate to insure no fire hazard remains. Therefore, each job should be individually evaluated to make sure the fire watch surveillance period is sufficient.  

        Security measures should cover entry of emergency personnel to controlled/limited access areas. Unnecessary delays can significantly increase fire damage.

"1588",1090,"Duke, Joseph ","Pegasus/SCD 1 Launch Anomaly Review Committee Final Report of March 1993"," An apparent momentary dropout of the Command Destruct Receiver initiated an abort during the launch of a Pegasus vehicle. 

     The lesson offers 10 recommendations (dealing mostly with mission rules, launch constraints, and communications) to prevent similar incidents in the future and improve overall range operations. "," The Review Committee concluded that the primary cause for this incident was that the Range Safety abort was rescinded without on net authority and range awareness. The principal contributing factors to this incident were the off net communications; and confusion that resulted from having two separate operational nets, the lack of sufficiently detailed and attended prelaunch briefings, and the lengthy process of communicating with the B-52. 

     The Review Committee during its investigation has compiled a list of findings and conclusions. They have been grouped in the following categories: 

      
        Abort Process  

        Mission Rules  

        Communications  

        Launch Day Roles and Responsibilities  

        Mission Planning and Preparation  
      

     ABORT PROCESS 

     FINDINGS 

      
        An abort was initiated by the WFF/RSO, the abort was rescinded by the contractor TC without on net authority and range awareness.  

        The B-52 was required to reduce altitude just prior to the CDR dropout abort call.  

        WFF, Eastern Range (ER), Merritt Island Tracking Station (MILA) and Bermuda Tracking Station (BDA) responded in a manner which allowed continued flight of the Pegasus after launch  

        There was no procedure in the WFF/OSD or the Contractor Launch Checklist (LC) that detailed the procedure for rescinding an abort.  
      

     CONCLUSIONS 

     From the above findings, the Committee reached the following conclusions: 

      
        The contractor TC method of rescinding the abort was inadequate.  

        Fin battery actuation was a consideration in the decision to rescind the abort.  

        The altitude problem may have contributed to the confusion concerning the abort.  

        Capability to destruct the Pegasus was maintained throughout the flight.  

        Quick positive reaction by all supporting personnel allowed this flight to continue to a successful conclusion.  
      

     MISSION RULES 

     FINDINGS 

      
        An apparent dropout of a Flight Termination System (FTS) CDR occurred. This apparent dropout required an abort of the launch according to the mission rules.  

        Not all key personnel were aware of all mission rules. Additionally, in some cases, key personnel had different interpretations of mission rules.  
      

     CONCLUSIONS 

      
        There were misunderstandings among key personnel concerning the mission rules. Lack of awareness and misinterpretation of mission rules may have contributed to this incident.  

        The FTS CDR dropout mission rule produced a high risk of mission abort. The complex routing of the data stream (vehicle/aircraft to ground, ground to Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) satellite, satellite to ground) and the amount of support equipment necessary to provide this data (decoms, bit syncs, cabling) produced a high probability of data loss not related to CDR health.  
      

     COMMUNICATIONS 

     FINDINGS 

      
        No single Intercom Channel (IC) was understood by all key participants as the primary launch net.  

        The WFF/RSO chain of communication to the B-52 required 3 intermediaries.  

        The configuration of communication equipment used by NASA 1 and the contractor TC was operationally awkward.  

        Formal intercom net protocol was not consistently used.  
      

     CONCLUSIONS 

      
        The lack of a single IC for all critical calls that was monitored by all key personnel contributed to confusion and to the range's lack of knowledge of impending launch.  

        The chain of communication between the WFF/RSO and the B-52 contained too many elements.  

        Improved intercom net discipline may have prevented misunderstandings leading to the unplanned launch.  

        The contractor TC had expected to receive Range abort calls from the WFF/RCO on IC 4. The fact that the abort was only transmitted on IC 1 by the WFF/TD and heard off net by the contractor TC caused the contractor TC to question the abort call and delayed the passing of the abort to the B-52.  
      

     LAUNCH DAY ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 

     FINDINGS 

      
        There were no clear lines of authority and responsibility for launch decisions.  

        The OSC/TC rescinded the abort command without proper on net authority and range awareness.  
      

     CONCLUSIONS 

      
        The primary cause of this incident was that the OSC/TC rescinded the abort without on net authority and range awareness. The lack of clear lines of authority and responsibility contributed to his/her actions.  

        The limited abort scenarios exercised during the dress rehearsal were not sufficient to identify all authority and responsibility conflicts.  
      

     MISSION PLANNING AND PREPARATION 

     FINDINGS 

      
        No pre-launch briefing was held at which all key participants reviewed mission rules, constraints, and procedures.  

        The WFF/Operations and Safety Directive (OSD) and the Contractor's Launch Operations and Mission Constraints (LOMC) document contained conflicting information that was not completely integrated in the mission planning process.  

        A complete dress rehearsal was not conducted for this mission.  
      

     CONCLUSIONS 

      
        The pre-mission planning and preparation process was inadequate for a mission of the scope and complexity of the Pegasus / SCD-1 launch.  

        Conflicting Information in the various organizations' documentation may have contributed to this incident.  

        The lack of a pre-mission briefing attended by all organizations that reviewed roles, responsibilities, mission rules/constraints, IC assignments, and the launch decision process contributed to this incident.

"1600",1187,"Smith, Jackie ","Vehicle Assembly Building 250 Ton Crane No. 1 Close Call Mishap Investigation Board Report of November 12, 1992",""," An SPC Investigation Team and an independent NASA Investigation Board were unable to determine the exact cause of the close call. The closest duplication of the event was obtained from the Malfunction Laboratory tests of the crane metadyne and the crane 4NCR relay contacts. A metadyne is an externally driven D.C. generator, which amplifies an operator initiated control signal to regulate trolley speed. When closed, the 4NCR relay contacts provide the control signal to the metadyne. 

     Other crane components that could have caused an increase in trolley speed were removed from crane #1 and tested in the Malfunction Laboratory. None exhibited abnormal results. The Board recognized that operator actions could have produced the observed segment motion. However, based on testimony of the two operators, the investigation board concluded that the operators most likely did not induce the rapid unexpected movement of the segment. 

     Metadyne output voltage changes with no change to the input voltage were observed on numerous occasions during crane tests as well as during Malfunction Laboratory testing. These output changes could be induced by misaligning brushes, lightly tapping the brushes, injecting cleaning stone silica or cleaning cloth fibers into the commutator/brush area, or elevating humidity and temperature. Further the crane metadynes are operated at 2 percent of output capacity, which exacerbates these output instabilities. Review of text books and technical papers, and conversations with technical experts indicate that metadyne systems are susceptible to erratic outputs. The voltage output changes observed in the lab were significant in magnitude and, based on analysis, were large enough to produce the maximum calculated trolley velocity. 

     On September 14, 1992, in VAB High Bay #2, crane #2 bridge (same design as crane #1) experienced erratic acceleration, other unexpected responses, and eventually stopped completely. Troubleshooting determined that the control voltage input to the metadyne system was zero. Relay contacts that provide this control voltage were cleaned and crane operations returned to normal. Additional Malfunction Laboratory tests were performed on the power supply relay contacts and potentiometers. The relay contacts should have a resistance in the milliohm range but laboratory measurements were unstable and in the range of 100 ohms to 3 gigaohms. High resistance of the power supply contacts on the night of the close call could have occurred and, after a few minutes, the high resistance could have returned to normal. This would result in a sudden increase of trolley speed from a reduced to a full FINE speed condition of approximately 25 feet per minute. This very closely duplicates the timing
    and speeds that occurred during the close call. 

     In summary, the exact cause of this crane close call is not known. The most likely causes were determined to be an erratic operation of the metadyne caused by cleaning material contamination of the brush/commutator area or an excessive resistance increase of the control system relay contacts that suddenly returned to its proper value. 

     The contributing cause to the close call was determined to be that metadyne output varies with constant input. 

     Because metadynes are susceptible to unexpected changes in output, careful consideration of design and operating controls is required. Proper relay contact selection is especially important in a low current control system.

"1632",1186,"Holden, W ","Railroad Maintenance Contractor Boom Crane Mishap Investigation Team Report of April 9, 1992",""," It is the opinion of this mishap investigation team that the primary cause of this mishap was structural failure of the crane at the turret/mast interface, most probably due to fatigue cracking of the welded area in question. This area had cracked at some previous time and there is evidence of continued crack generation resulting in diminished load lifting capability of the crane. When the switch plate kits were loaded, their weight would not normally have exceeded the lifting capacity of the unit but did exceed its diminished capability. The result was a catastrophic failure leading to personnel injury and equipment damage. 

     Contributing to the failure cause was possible momentary overloading of the crane. No data was discovered that indicated the crane had been overloaded and in fact, the design of the hydraulic system precludes that from happening. No evidence was found, however, of operator training beyond on-the-job experience and that lack of proper training could have resulted in poor operating technique imparting momentary loads well in excess of crane capability, setting up a progressive fatigue cracking mechanism. The weld area in question had cracked at some time prior to this failure and there was evidence of attempts to repair cracks. The workmanship of this repair was extremely poor and failed to correct the problem. The fatigue cracking continued to progress to the point of failure. 

     Also noted during this investigation were deficiencies in meeting contractual and OSHA/ANSI requirements. No evidence was found of daily, weekly, or monthly safety inspections of the equipment or contractually required safety reports. No evidence was found of an annual inspection for safety and operability. No evidence was found that the operators had received any training beyond on-the-job instruction on operation of the unit.

"1637",1199,"Sullivan, J ","OV-104 STS-38 Avionics Bay Platform Beam Assembly Incident - Formal Accident Investigation Board Report",""," The primary and major contributory causes of the mishap were:  
     

      
        Failure to remove the beam. If the standard sequence of access platform removal is followed, the beam is one of the last components to come out. Also, the beam cannot be safely removed until either the 50-1 or 50-2 entry level platforms are removed. Since other scheduled work was in process, requiring the entry level platforms, the beam was temporarily and intentionally left resting against the 1307 bulkhead for approximately 40 minutes. Due to the elapsed time and remote location of the beam, plus reduced lighting, the beam was forgotten and overlooked.  

        The check and balance by the technician and the Quality Control inspector failed. The technician and inspector were using a job card matrix, consisting of prerecorded platform component numbers which had been initially recorded during platform component installation. The removal check-off and accountability operation was being performed at floor level as opposed to the more traditional method of verification where the platform components are removed and verified as they cross the access ' door thresholds. The rationale for this change consisted of three considerations: (A) the bay was destined for maintenance rather than early roll-in of the next orbiter and, therefore, the platform components had to be completely removed from the work site and stowed; (B) the area where the platform components would have been inventoried and temporarily stowed was congested; (C) an opinion existed that a better check-off and accountability could be accomplished at the floor level rather
      than at the 50-1 and 50-2 access door exits.  
      
    The team responsible for job card matrix execution and ultimate removal verification consisted of one technician and one inspector. Several technicians were transporting the platform set assemblies from the 50-1 and 50-2 doors to the floor. As the technician read component part numbers, the quality inspector checked off the pre-recorded matrix. There were reported confusion factors consisting of multiple numbers on components and faded numbers; however, there was no practical correlation between these factors to explain why an error in accounting for the platform components occurred. For an unknown reason, the G070-502677-001 beam was counted as having been removed, and therefore, no subsequent search for it was made.  
      
    A probable scenario for the human error follows: piece number G070-502777-001 was mistakenly checked off the inventory list as G070-502677-001. After almost the entire inventory of platforms had been completed, the Tech and QC on the OPP floor started to review the inventory list to account for several items that had not yet been verified. Piece number G070-502777-001 was still not verified. In reviewing the assemblage of components, the Tech and QC found G070-502777-001 in the equipment storage area and marked it off the inventory list. Thus, component G070-502777-001 was probably counted twice as two pieces of equipment. This scenario was not presented by the Tech or QC, but is the most probable sequence of events that the Board feels occurred.
